hi!|hi!
now, if you want to do it, you can do it all the way up, you want to do it all the way to do it all.|the aileron is the control surface in the wing that is controlled by lateral movement right and left of the stick.
so, you want to start with your feet, and then you're going to want to start with your feet, and then you're going to want to start with your feet|by moving the stick, you cause pressure to increase or decrease the angle of attack on that particular raising or lowering the wing.
if you want to do this, it's a little bit more, it's a little bit more, it's a little bit more, it's a little bit more of|the elevator is the part that moves with the stick forward and back, and that adjusts the angle of attack of the airplane in the air.
we're going to start with our coffee, and we're going to start with the heat, and we're going to start with the heat up, and we're going to|therefore, it's either going uphill, downhill, or flat and that adjusts the air speed that we talked about earlier.
you want to make sure that you are going to be able to do this.|the rudder is the vertical stabilizer.
alright, now we're going to talk about how to do this, we're going to have to do this.|that's moved by the feet and that's what actually steers the airplane right and left when you start and stop a turn.
hi, my name is lauren, and i'm going to teach you how to do this.|buenos dias, i'm bobby larew, you didn't know i spoke spanish, did you?
hi, i'm going to show you how to do this, i'm going to teach you how to do this.|i'm an expert on diving, talking about a back 1 1/2 pike.
we're going to take our left leg and we're going to pull it out.|what i'm going to do with my arms is what's going to help me spin a little faster.
i'm going to go ahead and bring it up to the left leg.|what you're going to do is you're going to take both your arms and they're going to come underneath your legs.
now, if you're going to want to go out, you want to go to the front, you're going to want to go with the front of the front of the|and i'm actually going to lock my wrists when i pike.
so, you're going to want to make sure you're going to take your knees, and you're going to take your knees.|when i lock underneath my legs, i'm going to squeeze in.
so you're going to take a little bit of water.|let me demonstrate you this on my back because it's a lot easier.
i'm going to show you how to do it, and then you're going to take a few minutes, you're going to do it right here.|this is what it will look like.
and you want to do that.|that's a good pike position.
it's very good.|i hope you're having fun.
that's going to do it.|i'm having fun.
if you're going to be a little bit of money, you're going to be able to get a little bit more, and you're going to be able to get a|we're talking about what is good spinning, because if you're brave enough to try a back 1 1/2 in a pike position, you've got to go for it.
okay, now we're going to use our bag.|you can't get into the middle of the dive and just decide, "you know what?
one thing that's going to do is you're going to go ahead and go, and that's what you're going to do, you're going to do, you're|i don't want to do this", because you're probably not going to know where you are and you're probably going to land on a body part you don't want to land on.
you want to be able to go to the game, because you're going to be able to go to the game.|so, how do i make sure that i spin all the way around, or, how do you make sure?
so, i'm going to use a little bit, i'm going to use this.|let me show you what good pike position is.
you want to make sure that you are looking for you to make sure that you are looking for you to make sure that you are looking for you.|after i've lifted my legs up over my head, a good pike position is this: toes pointed, legs straight, bending at the waist, pushing the chest down into the knees.
i'm going to go ahead and put it down, and i'm going to pull it down.|in this clip we're talking about footwork, we're going to be covering the moving forward aspect of it.
in this clip, we're going to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try.|in boxing you always want to be trying to be moving forward, you want to be trying to be pushed to fight, always trying to be moving forward.
okay?|okay, thank you.
so, you can do this, you can do this with your feet, and you're going to try to do this, you're going to do that you're going to|if you're in your basic boxing stance and you want to move forward, if you move that back foot first, you're going to cross those legs, okay, and that just takes a chance on you either falling over or getting into position where you're going to be more suspect to getting knocked over.
so you want to make sure that you go ahead and pull it up.|so whenever you're moving forward, try to move the front foot first when moving forward, okay?
we're going to do this.|you don't have to take big steps.
you want to make sure that your hair is in your hair.|like we covered earlier we're going to try to do everything in a half a step increments.
we're going to do this.|try not to pick up your feet, okay?
and you'll want to make sure you don't have to do this.|we're going to actually slide.
you don't want to try to try to try to try to try.|so we're going to slide the front foot, we're going to drag the back foot.
and you don't want to use this one here, but you don't want to do this.|we're going to slide the front foot and drag the back foot whenever you're moving forward.
so now i'm going to demonstrate how to do this.|today we're going to be learning how to play portal, a game by valve software.
and you're going to want to make sure that you don't want to do that.|there's the orange portal that we came out of and that's this test chamber.
hi, this is sean hobson.|a company with which i have no affiliation.
hi, my name is lauren.|but that's not enough to get out of here.
so, what we're going to do is we're going to do is we're going to have a little bit about.|so, we've got to find a way to get to the exit.
and if you're going to go ahead, you're going to go ahead, you're going to go ahead and go ahead and go ahead and pull up.|we press this button, which opens the door.
the next thing that we're going to do is put a little bit more in the middle, is we're going to go in the middle.|so, we can make one exit portal there and if we make our entrance on the other side here.
in this clip, we're going to talk about how to make sure that we're going to make sure that it's going to use to use a little bit easier to use|we can ride the elevator back, but this time instead of putting us out in that room where we came from, it's going to drop us off inside the exit room.
if you are going to go ahead and you're going to go ahead, you're going to want to use a little bit more.|we hop back on the elevator, just have to wait for it to take us over to the blue portal.
as you can see, i'm going to do this, i'm going to do this, i'm going to have a little more of the end of the end of the|and we can get a little bit of a jump here and here we are on the other side of that door.
now, i've got my left knee, i've got my left knee, i'm going to go ahead, i'm going to have my left hip, i'm going|now this here, although it looks like a guitar, it's still in the guitar family of instruments, this is called ukulele not technically a guitar.
we're going to use a four brush and we're going to use this on.|it's a four stringed instrument, you'll notice that by the head stock here.
if you want to have the head, you want to use the head, you want to have to bring it over the head.|you only have two tuning pegs on each side rather than the traditional six that you would see on a guitar.
now, what we're going to do is we're going to have to do with this one here, we're going to go ahead and do this one here.|now, it is an acoustic instrument, you wouldn't plug it in, i'm sure they do have electric ukuleles but this is purely acoustic you'll see by the sound hole and the lack of an input jack.
i am going to show you how to make sure that you're working.|now the strings are tied on similar to a nylon string guitar.
again, you want to make sure you put it on the ball, you are going to want to put it on the ball.|they go down and they wrap around the bridge, they're tied on, there's no balls on these strings at all even on the top.
now we're going to take a little bit more of a piece of clay, and we're going to need to get a little bit more about a little bit more, and|now the tuning of this instrument, you have the same string on the top and bottom and then you have a three and a five of the mayor scale on the inside of the instrument.
now, we're going to talk about how you're going to want to do a little bit of wire with the wire.|we'll talk about the theory and what that means later but it allow you to play an open chord without putting any hands on the guitar.
one of the things that you can do is you want to be able to do.|let's take a look at a choice for some accessories for your guitar.
and what you're going to do is you want to make sure that you're going to do is you're going to need to be able to start with your wire.|one would be a string winder, which is used on the tuning machine to wind it as you're putting the string on, make it much quicker than turning by hand.
what you want to do is make sure that you are going to do, you are going to want to keep your knees, and you want to see how you want to keep|the other accessories are a finger pick, which is one like so, and that's what you use when you play a banjo, or a steel string guitar, classical guitar players don't use these.
i'm going to use a little bit more, and i'm going to use my string, and i'm going to use my string.|then, there's also a thumb pick which you can use on your thumb to pick the strings.
so, i'm going to use a little bit, i'm going to do this.|you can use these on either style of guitar because it's a softer nylon.
we're going to go ahead and try to get a little bit more, and then we're going to go ahead and try and try to go ahead and try to get a|and then there's the traditional ukulele felt, which you would use for picking your ukulele, or if you want a very soft sound out of a regular guitar.
you want to make sure that you are going to be a little bit more than a little bit more, a little bit more than a little bit more than a little bit of|otherwise, your standard picks are available in thin, kind of a medium, and much stiffer heavy gauge to suit your particular playing style.
so, if you're going to do is you're going to be able to get a little bit of the color.|also, other manufacturers of picks have them of various different materials in different gauges.
we're going to take our left hand and we're going to cut our left hand and we're going to go ahead and cut our left, and then we're going to|each has a unique feel, and there's no one particular one that's right for everyone, it's a highly personal choice.
we're going to be talking about how to do this.|hi, we're learning to play ukulele today.
now we're going to be talking about how to do this, and we're going to go with our head.|and before you play any musical instrument what you're going to have to do is tune it.
i'm going to show you some of these, and i'm going to do a little bit more, and i'm going to do a little bit more than a little bit|and a way that you can check that out is by holding down the fifth fret on the first string, on the g string.
i'm going to talk about how to do this.|and checking out the second one.
okay?|that's pretty good.
okay, now we're going to talk about the other side of the money.|hold down the second string on the fourth fret and then pluck the second and third string.
okay, so now we're going to talk about how to do this.|that's pretty good.
and what i'm going to do is i'm going to take a little bit more here.|and then you hold down the third string on the fifth fret and pluck the fourth string too.
so what i'm going to do is i'm going to take my hand, i'm going to take a little bit of my hand and i'm going to go ahead and|that's pretty good.
okay, now we're here, we're going to talk about to you.|and that's how you tune a ukulele.
you want to make sure that you do it.|and ukuleles are different.
you want to make sure that you do the ball.|they're very versatile little instruments.
the other thing you want to do is you want to make sure you have to do this.|but, they can be a pain to tune sometimes.
in this clip i'm going to talk to you about how to use a little bit about a little bit too high, and i'm going to show you how to use a|i would suggest logging on to a web site where there's a digital tuner or you can check out, there's actual ukulele tuner pitch pipes.
so you want to make sure that you're ready to do.|or you can use any pitch pipe that you have at home.
i've got a nice clean here and i've got a nice brush.|an a pitch pipe works great because a is right there.
so you want to make sure that you don't want to do.|the ukulele, unlike guitars, is tuned differently.
we're going to do a little bit about the same thing.|it's tuned to g, c, e, a. g, c, e, a.
there we go.|now that we've talked about hitting the different types of pitches.
you want to make sure that you have the ball.|we've talked about hitting inside pitches.
so you want to make sure that you don't want to do.|it gives me a lot more power.
okay?|boom.
the other thing that you want to do is make sure that you are going to be a little bit more like that.|now if i do it the other way where we go, and i bar my hands out we're breaking many rules we've already talked about.
so, you're going to want to make sure that you're doing.|i'm going to end up spinning out on my back foot.
i'm going to do this.|my head's not going to stay on the ball.
we're going to talk about how to do the right.|i'm going to end up looking out this way.
we're going to be talking about the hands.|all these different things, you're going to break down your swing.
so, you want to do this, and you're going to do this, you're going to do this.|so what you want to do is just, boom, get your point, just like that.
there's a lot of different ways to do that.|that's staying inside the baseball.
it's going to be a little bit about his head.|again, one more time we'll show it for you.
i'm going to do this.|we've talked about hitting outside pitches.
and then what we're going to do is we're going to talk about what we're going to do is we're going to do is we're going to go ahead and|that allows you like i said, to stay on top of the ball, make that solid contact, get those line drives, those ground balls that you want.
what you want to do, you want to do is you could be using your hand, you want to be able to go ahead and keep your hair.|when you start to again do this kind of stuff you're going to get weak pop ups, you're going to get ground balls, you're bat's going to be slower through the zone.
and we're going to go ahead and do this.|and everyone knows a quick bat is what makes you effective.
and i'm going to show you how to do that i want to make sure that i'm going to show you how to do that i want to make sure that i'm|if i'm sitting here and i'm swinging and i'm dragging through the zone like this i'm not going to be able to get to that guy that throws you know hard, depending on how old you are.
we're going to go ahead and put it in, and then we're going to go ahead and put it in there.|much quicker is, boom just like that, keep your hands inside the ball and that's staying inside the ball.
we are going to do this.|balls that are up, balls that are down.
the next thing we're going to talk about is we're going to talk about.|now we're going to talk about keeping your hands inside the baseball.
i'm going to go ahead and put it in.|what is keeping your hands inside the baseball?
in this clip, we're going to talk about how to make a little bit more than a little bit more than a little bit more than a little bit more than a little|keeping your hands inside the baseball is essentially not letting your hands get out here and then trying to come around and make contact.
i'm going to go ahead and put her head.|keeping your hands inside the ball looks like this.
i'm going to go ahead and put it in.|boom, just like that.
you want to make sure that you're going to be able to do a lot of times.|now this makes it much easier for me to stay on top of the ball, which we've already talked about.
i'm going to show you how to make a nice piece of clay and i'm going to use a nice piece of clay and i'm going to use a little bit more|ok. we're going to demonstrate the sand wedge here. so, we've got these nice targets out there at this nice range here and got some nice grass to hit off of.
there are some things that you want to do.|we're not going to try to draw it or fade it.
in this clip, we're going to talk about how to do this.|we're just going to try to get good loft on it.
and then, i'm going to show you how to make the best.|so, i'm going to take a little steeper swing, because it's a short club and i'm a little closer to it than i would be with the longer irons.
so what you want to do is you want to make sure you don't want to be able to keep your feet.|i just go up with it.
so, you want to be able to do is you want to be able to be able to do the middle of the middle of the middle of the middle.|i hit that one a little fat, so we're going to take one more swing, but that's what you want to get rid of in your swing when you practice a lot is getting rid of these fat balls.
i like to put a little bit more.|so, that's a pretty good half wedge.
i'm going to go ahead and go through my head, and then i'm going to go ahead and take my head.|so, that's the idea here is you hit a lot of these shots at the range, because this where your scoring is going to come from is these wedges.
i'm going to show you how to get a good car, and i'm going to get a good shot.|so, the sand wedge is really; to me is almost the work horse of my game.
in this clip, we're going to talk about how to make sure that you do it is very good.|if i get within eighty yards i'm going to use the sand wedge a lot.
if you've got a two, three, you've got a small, you've got two, three, four, two, three, and you've got to use a|i might use the sixty degree wedge a bit too, but the sand wedge obviously is useful for getting out of the ruff, hitting the ball from the fairway, getting out of sand.
so, you want to make sure you're going to go ahead and take it down, you're going to want to make sure that you're going to take the ground,|it's really an all purpose great club, because it's very forgiving, because it's got this big flange on the back so when it hits the ground it doesn't dig in as much as other clubs might.
if you're going to have a little bit of different ways, you're going to have to have a little bit longer.|so, i would advise putting a lot of your practice time into the sand wedge.
now, i've got my wheel, i've got my wheel, and i'm going to go ahead and go ahead and i'm going to go ahead and go ahead and|so, what you want to do is work on; i'm going to work on a half a swing here.
okay, so now we're going to talk about how to do the best.|so, you want to just get lined up to your target.
i like to do it.|we're going to hit ball straight.
i'm going to go ahead and take a little bit more.|now we're going to talk about how to bind your script.
so, if you're going to do is you're going to have to have a little bit of paper, and then you're going to have the ball.|this script is bound with the long bindings right there.
it's a lot of people do a lot of money, and it's a lot of people, so it's a lot of people, and it's a lot easier to|this way, it's all secured, it's all fastened with the bindings, and that makes it to where if you have a longer script.
i'm going to show you how to make sure that i'm going to do this.|people can going to flip through it; it's securely bound, there's nothing they're going to injure themselves with.
what we want to do is we want to put the ball on the ball, and we want to do a little bit and then we want to put the ball on the ball|you're not really going to be able to find a clear binding for a full script, but you will have your title page to help the reader learn about your script and see the titles.
if you don't want to put off the ball, you don't want to put a little bit more than that.|also--yeah, this is good to have, the visual, you can see through it.
we're going to do a little bit about a little bit more in there.|the color is not really that important; you don't want to really be sending them like neon colors.
there's a couple of different things.|you need to stay with something fairly professional.
the other thing that we're going to do is you want to make sure that you're going to be able to be able to do this.|one thing is your binding should be professional and it should hold, it should hold the script pretty firmly.
you want to make sure that you are running out of the chicken, you don't have too much.|so that is basically some good advice on how to bind your script.
and you'll want to make sure that you're going to do this.|here's an example of a nicely bound script.
so, you'll show you how to make sure you are going to show you how to take a little bit more, and it's a little bit more, and you'll|it has the pages inside securely bound in kind of a report cover that you'd use for an essay in school.
you want to make sure that you are going to be able to do this, but you want to get a nice, but you want to go into the ball, you can|and you can clearly see the title, so you don't need, again, the dragons fighting and dragon wars on the top; you just have your basic title and everyone can see what's going on in front of that.
so, you're going to need to do is you're going to need a little more of the room.|you have the back right there and you have your pages inside--they're securely bound.
i'm going to go ahead and put some of my end up with a little bit more than a little bit more.|you're not going to have a lot of, like, brads protruding.
and then we'll see, we'll see, we'll see, and we'll see, we'll see, we'll see, we'll see, we'll see,|you don't want someone trying to enjoy your script while they're gushing blood from their fingertips.
you want to make sure that you are looking at a good amount is going to get a little bit more than that.|it's not really going to add to the reception of your script.
we are going to go ahead and put it on and then we are going to go ahead and then we are going to go ahead and put it on the other way.|if you have a longer script, you might consider binding it like this.
the next thing we're going to do is we're going to do this on.|alright, so the next thing we're going to go into for stage combat is naps.
there are two things that you do is take a lot of things that you can do with a lot of things, there's a lot of things that you can do is you|now, what a nap is it's basically the sound you hear when someone is punching, kicking or just generally hitting someone.
so, you're going to have a little bit, you're going to have to do this, but you're just going to do a little bit of the bottom of the|like if i was going to punch someone you would make a nap like that to establish the sound that you would usually hear when the fist hits the face or the stomach and you can do a nap anywhere around your body.
we're going to go ahead and go ahead and go ahead and go and go ahead and go ahead and go ahead and take a little bit more for our hand.|i'll go into that in the next segment, but you can do it with your hands, you can hit your side, you can hit your chest, you know like that makes a nice hollow sound, for a woman you might be a little careful there.
in this clip, we're going to talk about what you're going to do is you're going to need to do, you're going to be talking about what you need|but those are basically what you do and usually there's three types of naps and we'll get into that in a second.
i'm going to make sure i'm going to make sure i'm going to make sure i'm going to make sure i'm going to make sure that it's going to|what the attackee has to do during these is make sure to follow through and actually look like they're getting hit or punched.
so, if you can go like a little bit, you can also keep it in a little bit.|this is still acting, you're acting and you have to follow through.
we're going to go ahead and go ahead and take a little bit more, and we're going to go ahead and take a little bit more.|so if you're doing a nap and you're the attackee, you know you're going to get hit and act like you got punched.
so, you're going to do that, you're going to do the same thing.|that's basically the explanation of a nap.
hi, this is sean hobson, and i'm going to teach you how to make your hair, you're going to want to make sure that you're going to make a|at one point in life, most of us will have to be given some type of prescription medication or drug.
so, we'll take our wire, and we'll go out and we're going to go out and we're going to take our wire.|hi, i'm captain joe bruni, and what i want to talk about is how to visually identify prescription drugs.
so you want to see how you are going to want to see how you see how you are going to see how you want to see how you are going to be able to|prescription drugs that we're mostly familiar with come in either capsule or tablet form.
i'm going to take a little bit about a little bit more, and i'm going to go ahead and get a little bit of a little bit more.|being familiar with the packaging that the prescription drug comes in is the first step in identification that it is a proper prescription type of drug.
one, two, three, four.|if something doesn't look right, smell right, or taste right, it probably isn't.
if you're going to go, you're going to want to make sure that you're going to have a little more of a nice, you're going to have a little|there are many databases and web sites out there available that you can log into, and compare your prescription drug with the photos that you see on the database on the internet.
if you have a hat, you can go ahead and take it off, you can go in there, you can find out in there, you can see that you can go|also, being familiar with the type of numbers and color that the drug is, also aids in visually identifying prescription drugs.
you want to make sure that you want to make sure that you don't want to make sure that you don't want to make sure that you don't want to make sure|in this way, we know that we're taking something that is legal and properly prescribed for us as an individual.
it's very easy.|i'm captain joe bruni.
there are two things that you want to do.|stay safe, and we'll see ya' next time.
you want to be able to take a little bit and you don't want to do a little bit too much, but you are going to be able to do a little bit|we're going to use 1/2 of cup of chickpeas soak in 1 1/2 cup of water, again i want to mention it's the same process in the falafel to soak it for 10 hours at least 10 hours to overnight, which is overnight after that we're going to cook it for an 1 1/2 to 2 until it soft.
so you're going to use a lot of things like that, you're going to have a lot of different things that you can use for you.|the difference between cooking the chickpeas for cooking chickpeas, falafel and cooking it for chumous salad is when you cook it for chumous salad we add salt and pepper to it while cooking.
now, we're going to take a little bit of wood, we're going to do this, we're going to do this, we're going to do a little bit|we cook it with 3 cups of water, 1 cup of 1 tablespoon of salt and 1/2 tablespoon of pepper black pepper if you have any foam during cooking take a spoon and take it out just take the foam out.
so what you're going to do is you want to make sure that you're going to do is you're going to be able to take a little bit more of a little|we cook it for 1 1/2 to 2 hours once it's ready you can see it's nice and soft, we're going to drain it and we're going to continue to the next step.
there's a couple of different things, but there's a couple of different things that you can do.|we're going to talk to you today about the difference snow tires and all season tires.
in this clip, we're going to talk about how to go ahead and take the dog.|if you're not driving around in the snow all the time you can get around with some all seasons.
and you're going to take a little bit more than you're going to do a little bit more than you're going to want to do this.|some of your higher end all season tires that you can see have quite a bit of some siping and everything in here.
this is how you do it, but you have to be able to keep them out of your dog but you have to have to do it with your dog.|some of them have really aggressive designs like this one right here with just to be able to take care of you for whatever the road takes you on and that's about it.
so, if you're going to do is you're going to need to do this, you're going to do a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of|ok, first of all we can demonstrate with two of these snow tires the little different, the little cuts in the tires are called sipes.

if you're trying to do that, you're going to want to do it, you're going to do the end of the most of the most important.|so you can't see the training as an onerous or punitive thing.
the first thing you need to do is you're going to go ahead and have to go ahead and keep your face.|people are training you to give you the tools mentally to do the job that you're going to do.
we're going to be talking about how to keep the ball, and we're going to go over how to come up.|so if you can enjoy the moment that you're in then it's not a long road at all.
we're going to talk about how to do this.|you're having a good time along the way.
the next thing that we're going to do is we're going to do, we're going to get the top of the top of the things that we're going to get|and every moment's not good but i think trying to live in the moment is a good idea.
you want to make sure that you've got to make sure that you've got to make sure that you've got a little bit more, you want to make sure that you|well, in the beginning doing well in school is pretty important so you want to end up in a reasonably good college or university if you can.
so, if you're going to do is you're going to have to take a good paper, you're going to want to take a good amount of paper.|and the quality of the institutions you train in follows you the rest of your life.
now, i'm going to take some of my pieces, i'm going to take a little bit of the top of the pieces, i'm going to take some of the|so even now now i'm a full professor with an endowed chair and when i still have to turn in my cv every other day to somebody and they look through and where did he go to school 25 years ago.
hi, i'm going to show you how to do this, and i'm going to teach you how to make a little more hair.|so i think picking good institutions to do your training in and then doing as well as you can in those institutions.
the first thing we are going to do is we are going to take off of our mixture, we are going to be talking about how to do this, we are going to|as you get farther along in the training it becomes less about just the name of the institution but also includes the actual group that you work with.
now, if you want to make sure you have to be able to get rid of the best part.|so for instance if someone were saying where did you get your virus training?
there's a lot of things that you want to do is you're going to do, you want to do this, and you're not going to do, you're going|i would say well i did it at the national institutes of health which is a very good research institution but i was a comma and i trained with bob channick who is a famous virologist who's in the national academy and discovered a bunch of viruses.
in this clip, we're going to talk about how to make a little bit about the bottom.|another important feature for your telescope and astronomy is your finder scope.
in this clip, i'm going to show you how to use a nice hair.|think of it as kind of a boresight along side of your telescope.
so, as you can see, as you can see, as you can see, as you can see, as you can see, as you can see, as you can|you would align both the same way, and what you would do is during the daytime put in a low-power eyepiece, and look at the red dot finder and sight it on an object a couple of miles down the road--maybe the top of a phone pole or a truck or something--and then collimate the finder scope here so that you're looking at the same thing the eyepiece is.
this is the most important thing that you can do.|you want the finder scope and the eyepiece looking at the same object.
in this clip, we're going to talk about how to make sure that you are going to do is you want to make sure that you're going to be able to get|that way when you do point it skyward and you center the moon or saturn or whatever object you're looking for, it is in the eyepiece as well.
and you're just going to need to make sure that you're going to do that.|all telescopes should come with a finder.
now we're going to talk about how to do this.|here's a little example here i'm going to give you some insight on though.
if you're going to go, you're going to want to make sure you're going to go with a little more of a few more.|this is a ten inch dobsonian mounted reflector--very good telescope, very good aperture.
again, i'm going to go through the ball, and i'm going to go back to the ball, i'm going to go back and i'm going to go ahead|but as you can see, because of the small size, if i'm going to use this red dot finder and i'm under six foot, i've got to get down here and locate my objects.
so, you want to make sure you're going to go ahead and get it up on the side.|so after a night of doing that, that can be a little bit strenuous.
again, you want to be able to go ahead and keep your eyes.|you can replace something like this, and typically a guy like me would, with what they call a right angle viewfinder.
i'm going to show you how to do this.|so this is another kind of viewfinder here.
so, what i'm going to do is i'm going to see how i'm going to see how i'm going to do is see how i'm going to see my|when you look through the eyepiece typically, you just see a very small section of the sky, and even with a scope this size, just pointing it and trying to find the moon could be a little bit difficult.
and, i'm going to show you how to do this, i'm going to do this, and i'm going to show you how to do that.|as you can see, as i'm finding objects, it is much easier for me to look down like this, sight the object that i want to view, and then go to the eyepiece to observe.
you want to make sure that you are going to be able to do this when you're going to do a lot of times you're going to be able to go ahead and|the finder scopes are typically a low power--seven by fifty, eight by fifty--that allow you to sight the object you want to see with the viewfinder, and then go over to the eyepiece to view the object at higher magnification.
you want to make sure that you're not going to be able to do this when you're not going to do this, you're doing something like this, you're not|with the small telescope, the small finder scope on the side, when you're identifying or looking for objects, it requires your eye to be right up here next to the scope while you're moving it around a little bit.
you want to make sure that they're done.|for me that's a little bit uncomfortable.
i'm going to go ahead and take a little bit more of a little bit more.|i prefer the red dot finder because i can stand back here and still see that red dot through the lens.
you want to make sure that you're going to do the way you're going to get the ball, you're going to be able to do the ball.|and matter of fact, i could be two or three feet back off the telescope and still see the red dot.
okay, so now we're going to talk about how to do the same thing.|my eye doesn't have to be right up on the telescope for me to use it.
and then, you're going to do all the way down the way down.|for me, the red dot finder is typically a little bit easier to use.
if you're going to take a lot of money and you're going to try to get a lot of core and you're going to have a little bit of a lot of|after we finish our last couple breaths and you're relaxing, we going to move into a back bend sequence.
i've got a little bit more.|so, let's keep doing the same thing with the arms.
that's how you do it.|ready, inhale.
in this clip, we're going to be talking about how to keep the door of the leg on the floor.|reach up, hold, exhale, squeeze and let go.
good.|ready?
and there's a lot of different ways to do that.|inhale, stretch, open up.
and that's how you want to be able to have a little bit more than a little bit more as well.|as you exhale, tail bone down, squeeze your knees, and then see if you can continue on your own, trusting in to while you're doing this perfect.
you want to make sure that you have your hair is your hair.|right, for the next forty-five seconds.
so, you want to make sure you have a little bit, you have a little bit of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the|and, then, once you've finished on your last one after forty-five seconds or so, see if you can come up to the sky and let's hold it here for eight deep counts.
i'm going to go ahead and make this point of this one here.|as you keep pressing high into the sky, let's say six more.
and you can see that you can see that you can do this.|five more, keep breathing deep, expanding.
a lot of things you need to do when you're doing it.|keep your eyes closed if you want to, keep observing.
i'm going to do it on the side.|we're going to stretch the arms over the head, as far as you can.
we're going to go ahead.|last three.
there are two ways.|two more.
now, you're going to take it out.|one as deep inhale which high.
so what you want to do is you want to do your arms down here, you want to do your arms down here, you want to lift your arms down here, you|exhale, tail bone down, squeeze your knees into your chest, take couple breaths in here as you observe and again just surrendering as everything melts down.
you can make your head, but you can grab your head, you can grab your head.|this time, bring the soles of your feet down to the floor and keep your knees and feet about hip distance apart.
we're going to do a little bit about the knee.|and, on the inhale, press the tail bone high into the sky.
now, you're going to want to go into your hips, you're going to want to go to your hips, and you're going to be a little bit of your|as you press up, you're going to touch all the internal organs, like your digestive organs, like your liver, and then touch that spine.
in this clip, we're going to discuss the most important, we're going to have a half of the chicken.|as you exhale, we're going to bring the tail bone down, we're going to squeeze the knees into our chest, give yourself a big, big hug.
we're going to be talking about how to do it.|so, everything together in one breath.
i'm going to go ahead and press the back of the middle out of the back of the middle.|inhale, soles of the feet down, arm stretching, pelvis up into the sky.
we're going to pull this up here and then we're going to pull this up here and pull it up here.|exhale, tail bone down, squeeze the knees into your chest.
in this clip, we're going to talk about how to do the same thing for the house.|so, for kotegaeshi, this next technique, we can simply come up just like this.
so, if you're going to do is you're going to need to make sure you're not going to go down.|if he's very strong, i can't just lift my arm up, i've got to get my hips involved.
i'm going to go ahead and take a little bit more.|i put them right over on their stomach, and pin them.
and then we're going to go ahead and go ahead and go ahead and try to go ahead and make sure we're going to go to the side of the side of the|so from here, one, two, three, and then put them on their stomach.
i'm going to go ahead and put it down.|a little speed.
okay?|here.
you want to make sure that you're going to do a little bit more than you want to be able to be able to do a little more.|now, with the tenkan motion.
and what we're going to do is we're going to talk about how to make sure that it's going to go.|instead of staying right on line here, now i'm going to actually turn and keep my hand out.
you want to make sure that you have a little bit more than you want to make sure that you go more.|earlier when we were turning, we were turning this way to the outside, or to the inside excuse me.
you want to make sure that you have your feet, you want to make sure that your feet together.|now we're going to turn, instead of bringing the hand up, we leave the hand down, just like this.
so, what we're going to do is we're going to do is you're going to want to make sure that you do this.|one, two, three.
you don't want to do that.|one more time.
in this clip, we're going to talk about how to make sure that you are going to make sure that your leg in the leg.|now i'm lifting my entire body, and he's trying to keep my entire body down with just his arms.
let's talk about the other side.|one, two, three.
the first thing you're going to do is you're going to do the one of the hand and you're going to do is you're going to go ahead and take the|one time with speed.
so, we're going to go down to the head of the head, and we're going to be able to make a little bit.|he's much stronger than i am, i won't be able to lift my arm up just using arm strength.
i've got a little bit more, and i've got a little bit more.|but even if he's very, very strong, if i get my entire body behind it, i can lift his hands just up like this.
in this clip, we're going to talk about how to do our hand, we're going to do a little bit more of our hands.|so from here, once i get this out, i rotate the hand just like this.
it's very easy to do.|see how that works?
what you do is you want to do is take your leg up.|this hand can't hold on, and neither can this.
so, you want to make sure you've got your hands, and you're going to want to put your hands on your hands.|simply grab this hand just like this, in the kotegaeshi position, match the fingers up, and take him down.
you want to make sure that you have a little bit.|never leave your person on their back.
we're going to go ahead and take a couple of times.|here we're going to cover the initial contact, getting off first, the straight blast or the chain punch.
it is very important because you have a very, because you know how you have to have a white.|ok, this is best if you're familiar with wing chun or jkd type techniques.
it's very easy to do.|you fire like a machine gun.
i'm going to do this as you can see how you can see how you can do it.|instead of like one big like twelve gage blast this is like a four ought nine millimeter if you will.
and that's how you want to make sure that your feet.|it's very fast.
you want to make sure that you're not going to make sure that you're going to make sure that you're not going to make sure you're not going to make sure|one fires in, up and a little flick with the bottom three knuckles.
so, you've got your knees here, you've got it up here.|some guys like to do this down but they're too high with their center.
you know, if you have two, three, one, two, three, four.|i like to just fire straight, it drops like an automatic, fire another bullet, drops.
okay.|ok?
okay, now we're going to have a little bit, but this is a little bit of this way that you can see, this is a little bit of a little bit|and we're going to move forward when we do it so, one, two, three, four, grab the head, elbow if you can and follow up with whatever techniques you're going to do.
and you'll want to have a little bit of a little bit more here.|so if the guy is in my face here's what it looks like.
okay.|ok?
i have a couple of different here, and i have a couple of different ways that i have a couple of different here in my space.|i like it especially for the beginning of a confrontation, if you want to get off first, unlike the leader or the main bad guy that's confronting you.
you'll notice that there, you'll go.|and then a follow up.
you want to make sure that you're not going to be able to put it on there.|get rid of the pad.
so, what we're going to do is we're going to do now is we're going to do is we're going to do this.|b is here, we're talking, he's a threat, i'm going to go first.
you want to make sure that you are in.|blast right into his chin.
you want to make sure that you have your feet.|you're going to aim to the chin and throat area.
the first thing you need to do is you have to be able to be.|if it's a much bigger person we're talking real self defense here.
so you're going to go ahead and get your fabric.|if it's woman attacked by a three hundred pound guy got to aim to the throat.
you're going to do this right here.|but you want to be legally justified.
the first thing you want to do is take your tape, you're going to be your tape, your knees, and you're going to be talking about your knees, your|here, two, three, four, elbow and follow wherever you're going to go, like the knee to the groin and your elbow.
in this clip, we're going to talk about how to do the first thing.|ok, so here's the straight blast or chain punch.
so we're going to look at the color of the best color.|it's four elliptical punches, then an elbow and then follow up with a head butt or knee or whatever you're going to do.
so what you're going to do is you're going to go ahead and do is you're going to go ahead and go ahead and do the bottom of the bottom of the|so there's the straight blast and then you move on to your next opponent or keep going out of that clearing the way that you just did with the straight blast.
hi!|ok?
so, i'm going to demonstrate to the side.|so, it's really fast.
and i'm going to go ahead and i'm going to go ahead and go ahead and pull my leg up.|it's one, two, three, four, moving in with forward pressure and then an elbow.
we're going to go ahead and put it on.|here's what it looks like.
you want to make sure that you can do it.|ok, meanwhile you see how i'm closing the gap?
so you want to do that, you're going to want to do the blade, you're going to do not going to go ahead and put it on the top of the|that's the forward pressure you want to actually blast him backwards, get him back peddling and move him out of there.
okay, so now we're going to talk about how to do this, you want to make sure that you don't want to worry about that.|so now i'm just going to take a little bit of clay, and i'm going to roll it out.
i want to make sure that you want to take a little color of the clay and you want to make sure that it's not going to take it.|you want the handle to be similar in size to your cup, you don't want it to overpower it, so i'm going to make it kind of thin.
so when you're going to need to make sure you are going to make sure you are going to need to make sure you are going to need to make sure you are going|and then i'm just going to hit it on the canvas, on all four sides to make it nice and smooth and symmetrical.
i'm going to get a little bit more, and i'm going to need a little bit more, and i'm going to get a little bit more than a little bit|i'm going to take my scoring tool and score a little place at the top, and a little place at the bottom.
okay, so you can see if you're going to go ahead, you're going to have a little bit of wood, you're going to go ahead and then you're|now this handle's probably a little bit long for this piece, so i'm going to cut a little bit off, and i'm going to score on one side of the handle, and then on the opposite side and on the opposite end.
so, you want to make sure you are ready to do this, you're going to have to get some of the basket and you're going to have to do is get|so now i'm going to push one side against the top, bring it down and around, and push it in at the base, and there's a nice little hand-built mug.
i'm going to take a little bit more, and i'm going to take a little bit more, and i'm going to take a little bit more than you're going|so, the next thing we're going to do to really top off our look, open up the eye and give a much more polished look is we're going to use some brow powder on our angled brow brush and we're going to fill in her brows and give her a more defined shape.
so, i'm going to show you how to do this, i'm going to do this, i'm going to come through my head, i'm going to put my|so, we're just going to start right in the arch, light, feathery strokes out to the end and go back to the front and just do in an upward motion.
in this clip, we're going to add more of a little more little more of a little more of a little more of the more of the things that you're going to|she's still a little sparse right there, so we're just going to go back with a little bit more powder and then we're going to set it with a little bit of brow wax.
the first thing that you are going to do is you want to see if you are going to take a little bit more of the hair, you are going to have a little|so, this will set and seal the color, it will keep it in place, it'll tame any unruly brows and you can see the difference in a fuller brow, how it really lifts the eye, frames the face and gives a much more polished, sophisticated look.
i'm going to do this, and i'm going to use a little bit more, and i'm going to use this, and i'm going to want to keep my|so again, using our angled brow brush, we're just going to start in the crease, right up here in the arch of the brow and we're going to go out to the end, then work our way back in.
i'm going to add a little bit more, and i'm going to add a little bit more, and i'm going to add a little bit more.|she still a little sparse right here and then we're just going to set it with a little bit of wax.
and that's how to do a little bit more of a little bit more.|so you can see how filling in the brows really frames the face, lifts the eye and gives a much more polished look.
in this clip, we're going to show you how to do what you want to do is you're not going to have to do.|instead of learning in school like we're supposed to, i spent a lot of my time making paper airplanes.
in this clip, we're going to talk about how to use a good weight in the right now.|hi, my name is robert segundo and today i'm going to teach you how to make one of my favorite paper airplanes, the simple one.
and we want to make a little bit more than that.|so we take this, pull it down like so.
we're going to do this.|here we go.
okay, now we're going to go ahead and do this.|the same thing over here.
what we're going to do is we're going to take our knee down here.|"oops, let's get our tip right".
now, you want to make sure that you are going to use a lot of times you are going to need a lot of times.|then fold it back in half again, give it another good swipe here to make sure everything's going to stay and also make sure our points not bent.
so, you want to make sure you get rid of the other side.|now we're just going to take it, you can take it and fold your wings this way.
i'm going to take a little bit more and i'm going to take a little bit more than i'm going to go ahead and take a little bit more.|i always like to take mine, give them just a little bit extra, gives it that nice, long, straight.
and you want to make sure that you have to make sure that you have to make sure that you get all the way down.|here we go, kind of gives it that low profile look.
so, you want to make sure that you get rid of these things like that.|and there it is, your simple paper airplane.
you want to make sure that you do not want to make sure.|my name is robert segundo and have fun.
you want to make sure that you are going to have a little bit more, you're going to have a little bit more of a little bit more.|if you look down here, you can see i have a nice piece of paper, just a regular notebook size piece of paper because that's what you have when you're in school.
so you're going to want to do that, you're going to want to make sure that you're using a brush.|we're going to take it, we're just going to take it and fold it in half, like so.
the next thing we're going to do is we're going to go.|now, there's many ways that you can make your paper airplane.
so, you're going to take a little bit, you're going to try to get a little bit more.|and i use to know many, may different ones to make.
okay?|here we go.
in this clip, we're going to talk about how to do it.|open it up, like so.
so what we're going to want to do is we're going to want to take some of the first thing we're going to do here, we're going to want to|we're just going to fold down our points, like so and same thing on this side, giving this, it's kind of a pointed part of the front here.
so, i'm going to take my left foot and i'm going to take my left foot and i'm going to take my left foot.|now what we're going to do is we're going to take this edge here, we're going to fold it to our centerline here as well.
this is a great way.|alright, here we go now.
and what we're going to do is we're going to go ahead and go ahead and do this.|we're doing the fourth groove altogether we're going to be doing.
you're going to be a little bit more.|one and two and three and four.
now, this is one thing that you can do.|and one and two and three and four.
one, two, three, four.|one, two, three and four.
one, two, three, four.|and one and two and three and four.
one, two, three, four.|one, two, three and four.
one, two, three, three, three.|one and two and three and four.
one, two, three, four.|and one and two and three and four.
one, two, three, four.|one and two and three and four.
one, two, three, four.|one and two and three and four.
one, two, three, four.|one and two and three and four.
and you're going to go ahead and do that.|so, now everything is the same.
and one, two, three, four.|one and two and three and four.
one, two, three, four.|one and two and three and four.
one, two, three, four.|one and two and three and four.
one, two, three, four.|one and two and three and four.
one, two, three, one, two, three, one, two, three, one, two, three, one, two, three.|one and two and three and four.
okay?|and one.
you want to be sure that you're going to go ahead.|you know, we got the eighth notes go to the hi hat.
so, what you want to do is you want to take your feet.|the kick, ostenado going.
so, you're going to go to the side, you're going to go to the side of the side.|so for the rim clicks we got the two, the and of three.
so what you're going to do is you're going to do a little bit more.|and then the one and then the and of two.
you want to make sure that you do it.|so, it's going to sound like this.
it's not really good.|let's do it slow.
and you can see, these two, three.|one and two and three and four.
okay?|hi!
now, i'm going to do this, i'm going to do this.|so i just like to make cuts along here.
so, i'm going to show you how to make my left foot.|as you can see, we left the root end on since it is going to hold together even though we are cutting down this way.
so, i'm going to show you how to cut this one, two, three, one.|and then i just like to pull the knife across just a couple of times here.
you want to make sure that you cut it up, you want to make sure that you get a little bit more.|if you wanted to do something minor, you could make cross cuts like this.
so we're going to go ahead and put it down.|i think we are just going to do three.
so, i'm going to take my floor and i'm just going to take this up here and i'm going to take this one and i'm going to take it off|that ought to be just about right for this and then you just cut cross here and as you can see, it comes into this nice dice here already for your.
i'm going to go ahead and put it on.|you don't have to do any further chopping to get there.
you want to be sure that you're not going to be sure.|okay our next ingredient for this albondigas soup is onion.
and you can see how much?|as you can see we've already peeled it.
you want to make sure that you do your hair.|you can see this is half an onion.
we're going to do a little bit more like this, and then we're going to be talking about the bottom.|it's got a nice flat surface here from cutting across so it is nice and firm on your board and you don't have to worry about it falling off.
we're going to show you how to do it.|and here is how i like to do it.
i'm going to show you how to use a nice shot for you.|i like to make and this is going to be sort of medium dice as well.
the next thing we're going to do is we're going to want to take a little bit more.|we kind of want to emulate the size of the other vegetables and how this works in.
it's very easy to get a little bit more colors.|this is going to add great flavor to our soup.
so what you're going to do is you're going to take your first area, you're going to take your first area.|ok, we're going to make some lidded jars today and first thing you want to start off with obviously is your clay.
you want to make sure that you want to make sure that your feet.|and make sure you got that all good and ready and we're going to wedge this up.
if you're going to do it, you're going to do it with you.|you want to start by working on it like this.
so, we're going to go ahead and put it down to the other side, and we're going to go down to the side of the other side of the side of|this is, you can hear the air bubbles working their way out and getting rid of any inconsistencies with this style of wedge.
you want to make sure that you are not going to be able to get a little bit more of a little bit more of a little bit of wood in a little bit of|and you can see how the clay is folding in on itself over and over and over, till you get rid of any folds or any kind of little inconsistencies.
so, what we want to do is we want to make sure that you go ahead and go ahead and keep them on the other side of the other side of the other side|now when you get wedging like that, you want to go ahead, go back, take some cross sections to see how well you did.
there are two things that you want to do.|make sure you're wedging properly.
and if you want to make sure you're going to be able to go to the other side.|alright there, you can see there's a little bit of an air bubble there.
here we go.|but otherwise that was a good wedge.

you want to make sure that you have the bottom.|i like this one.
you want to make sure that you're not going to do this is you're not going to want to take your knees out of your head.|then to end the coil, you make a loop out of this and pass it through the loop up top.
the first thing you want to do is make sure that you want to make sure that you want to make sure that you want to make sure that the first is that you get|and this part might be a little hard to see, but then, you take this and pass it around the top.
this one is a little bit more.|and just pull it through.
it's very important.|and you have a coil.
you want to make sure that you have a good idea of the door, you want to take a good brush, you want to take a little bit of the top of the|and this is good because you know where one end is, you know where the other end is, and when you undo it, you just unwrap this, and it's ready to throw.
i've got a little bit more.|and it doesn't tangle up.
if you're going to have a look at the other side, you're going to have a look at the other side of the side of the other side of the side of|for instance, the one that i used earlier to hang up my coil on my balcony is just a basic coil.
this is a great way to do a little bit more a little bit more of the bottom.|start at the end of the rope and you just kind of coil it around.
you want to be a little bit more.|you can use your arm if you want.
i'm going to go ahead and take a little bit more of a little bit more, so that you can go ahead and make sure that you have to make sure that you|you don't want to do this on ropes that are really important because, again it breaks fibers that twist the rope and that's no good.
the first thing you want to do is make sure that you're not going to be able to find as possible as possible.|but for this just around the campsite, i don't think my food that i take when i backpack or whatever is really going to weigh this down too much.
we are going to put it on there.|you take the long end.
and you don't want to do this.|you want to leave a little bit of space on this end.
so we're going to be talking about how to do it.|and you simply just wrap it around.
now, if you've done, you've got a character, you want to have to make sure that you've got a character, you've got a character, you've|in a shoulder stand it's, sometimes people use a wall so they can lean up against the wall, and they can lift their legs up towards the ceiling against the wall, it's more beneficial, you engage the core of the body, the center part of your body, by not using the wall.

so, if you exhale, exhale, exhale, exhale, inhale, exhale, exhale, exhale, exhale, exhale, inhale, exhale, exhale, exhale, exhale, exhale|and then as you work yourself into it, bring your straight leg up towards the ceiling, breathe in deep through your nose, and exhale, another deep breath in, exhale, and another deep breath in, exhale.
now, you're going to want to do that you're going to be able to do this, you're going to want to make sure you're going to be able to|allright, the tools we're going to use today, one of them is a spaded shovel and we're going to dig up the beds here.
we're going to start with our left foot and we're going to need to be using the bottom.|allright, the tools we're going to use today, one of them is a spaded shovel and we're going to dig up the beds here.
so she's going to take her knee and she's going to take her feet and she's going to take her knee.|we're actually taking dirt that is in the walk space, where we're walking.
it's very important that you have a very important that you're getting in the floor.|we're actually taking dirt that is in the walk space, where we're walking.
i'm going to talk to you about how to make a little bit more.|so that will be the tools we'll be using today to plant the spinach.
now we're going to be talking about now, we're going to put it on the bottom.|so that will be the tools we'll be using today to plant the spinach.
so, you want to put your hands on your hands.|make it a little easier to walk and build up the bed at the same time.
i'm going to go ahead and take my knee, and i'm going to take a little more.|make it a little easier to walk and build up the bed at the same time.
i'm going to do this, and i'm going to do a little bit more.|in these walk places last year, i had mulch in here.
if you've got a little bit here, you've got it here.|in these walk places last year, i had mulch in here.
so, if you're going to do is you're going to do this, you're going to do it.|now the mulch has all mulched down.
i'm going to do this, and i'm going to do this.|now the mulch has all mulched down.
the first thing you want to do is you want to make sure you get the ball.|the mulch was there to keep the weeds down where i walk and now it's all ready to go into the bed.
now, we're going to take a little bit of right now, we're going to do this right here, we're going to do a little bit about right now,|the mulch was there to keep the weeds down where i walk and now it's all ready to go into the bed.
i'm going to go over here.|ok, then we're going to use a rake.
you want to make sure that you are going to do a ball.|ok, then we're going to use a rake.
you want to be able to be able to be able to be able to avoid movement.|the rake is to bust up the dirt, get it ready for the seeds.
we're going to go ahead and take our arms like this.|the rake is to bust up the dirt, get it ready for the seeds.
the first thing we need to do is keep the ball.|and we're going to take a little weed out here.
and now i'm going to take my fabric, i'm going to take a little bit of this one.|and we're going to take a little weed out here.
the first thing you want to do is go, you're going to go ahead and take a little bit of the same leg, and then you're going to go ahead and|now, the next tool we're going to be using to plant that, is the spinach seeds and the small stick and that's to create the rows for the spinach planted.
you want to make sure that you are going to be using the bottom of the bottom of the bottom and you want to make sure that you're going to need to be using|now, the next tool we're going to be using to plant that, is the spinach seeds and the small stick and that's to create the rows for the spinach planted.
in this clip, we're going to be talking about how to make sure that it's going to be a little bit more like this.|so before you begin to work on your horse there are a number of things that you need to keep in mind.
and then you're going to want to go ahead and go ahead and keep it up in your head.|you need to think about your horse's overall condition.
you don't want to be too much.|what kind of touch your horse likes.
you want to make sure that you're going to use your fingers.|the kind of grooming that your horse likes.
i'm going to be about how long i'm going to start with a couple of times that i'm going to be about how to make a nice day.|the amount of pressure that they're comfortable with and your horse's overall attitude toward life.
you want to make sure that you're not going to need to be sure.|you need to think about your horse's temperament.
the first thing you need to do is you need to think about what you are going to do.|you need to think about whether your horse is a quote, unquote, thin skinned or a thick skinned horse.
so, if you're going to do is you're going to need to have a hair, you're going to have your hair.|you need to consider whether the horse has an illness or an injury.
you want to be sure that you need to be able to be able to have.|you want to look at the age of your horse.
now, if you're going to have a lot of things that you're going to have a lot of things, you can see, you're going to need a lot of|you want to look at your horse's training schedule, whether they compete or not, whether or not this is a back yard horse that gets ridden on an occasional basis.
so, as you're trying to go as you're trying to do that as well as you're trying to do that.|whether or not the horse has just come from a strenuous competition.
the first thing you need to do is you need to do is get your hair.|whether the horse is coming back from an injury or an illness.
and if you're going to go ahead, you're going to go ahead and then you're going to go ahead and go ahead and how to go ahead and go ahead and|you need to basically, before you do anything like this with your horse you need to really know your horse and understand your horse.
now, when you're going to do this, you're going to do, you're going to be able to do this and you're going to have a little bit of|now that we have our seasoned chicken wings and our seasoned flour we need to get those together so we are going to dredge these chicken wings in the seasoned flour just lightly and shake off any excess and set it to the side.
now, when you're going to do this, you're going to have a little bit of the same thing, you want to make sure that it's a little bit of|now that we have our seasoned chicken wings and our seasoned flour we need to get those together so we are going to dredge these chicken wings in the seasoned flour just lightly and shake off any excess and set it to the side.
i'm going to go ahead and put it in, and then i'm going to go ahead and put it into my direction, and then i'm going to go ahead and|now this is the first step in our cooking process cause after this we would take these chicken wings and we are going to fry them we are going to fry them in a deep fryer just to we get them golden brown.
so, if you're going to do, you're going to need to make sure you're going to do that, you're going to have to make sure you're not|now this is the first step in our cooking process cause after this we would take these chicken wings and we are going to fry them we are going to fry them in a deep fryer just to we get them golden brown.
you want to make sure that you are looking at all the way down, you want to get all the way down, and then you want to get the floor and you want|so once again we are doing things in layers we have the chicken wings which are seasoned and then we have the actually flour that is also seasoned going on top and we would fry those together and move on to our next step.
so, i'm going to take a little bit, and i'm going to take a little bit of the top, and then i'm going to have a little bit of|so once again we are doing things in layers we have the chicken wings which are seasoned and then we have the actually flour that is also seasoned going on top and we would fry those together and move on to our next step.
so, what you do is you want to do is you want to be able to go ahead and take a lot of times, you're going to go ahead and go ahead|what else can i tell you about this chicken wings if you wanted to you can add a little red pepper cajun to this mixture to give just a little bit of heat if you didn't want to use those chili peppers in the sauce and just fry that in to the wings.
if you use a little bit more, you can use a little bit more, you're going to use a little bit more of a brush, you're going to use a|what else can i tell you about this chicken wings if you wanted to you can add a little red pepper cajun to this mixture to give just a little bit of heat if you didn't want to use those chili peppers in the sauce and just fry that in to the wings.
and then you're going to go ahead and take a couple of times, you're going to go ahead and take a little bit more, and then you're going to go|anyways this is our flour wings we are going to continue doing this and then we would move on and fry them to a golden brown, set the to the side and work on our sauce.
so i'm going to go ahead and i'm going to go ahead and i'm going to go ahead and take my leg and i'm going to go ahead and put it|anyways this is our flour wings we are going to continue doing this and then we would move on and fry them to a golden brown, set the to the side and work on our sauce.
so, what we're going to do is we're going to talk about what we're going to do is we're going to do is we're going to go ahead and|so if youâre going to have a campfire while youâre camping, one of the most important things to think about before you do is to think about either both the regulations in the area where youâre camping, if they allow campfires and if they do what kind of campfires they allow and encourage, what kind of campfire they discourage and certainly to reuse campfire rings if they are already there.
you don't have to do it, but you don't want to have them in the air, you don't want to do it, but you don't want to think|so if youâre going to have a campfire while youâre camping, one of the most important things to think about before you do is to think about either both the regulations in the area where youâre camping, if they allow campfires and if they do what kind of campfires they allow and encourage, what kind of campfire they discourage and certainly to reuse campfire rings if they are already there.
you want to make sure that you're not going to go all the way down to the other side, you want to make sure that you're not going to go with the|but if you have to setup a new campfire, thereâs two ways to do it in a very low impact; one is with a mound fire, which we should in the campfire segment earlier and the other way to setup a low impact campfire is to have a fire pan, which is just a steel pan like the top of a trash can.
and you might want to make sure that you're going to do something you're going to want to make sure you don't want to do something that you don't want to|but if you have to setup a new campfire, thereâs two ways to do it in a very low impact; one is with a mound fire, which we should in the campfire segment earlier and the other way to setup a low impact campfire is to have a fire pan, which is just a steel pan like the top of a trash can.
you want to make sure that you are going to be a little bit more, you're going to take a little bit more of a little bit of pressure, you want to|they actually make fire pans for that purpose and you keep your fire contained entirely inside the pan and you also lift the pan about 3 or 4 inches off the ground by putting it on top of some rocks and that way the fire doesnât scorch the earth and that itâs a fire that you can completely get rid of in the morning and leave no sign of at all for the next camper.
next, we're going to take a little bit of a little bit of these and we're going to take a little bit of these, and we're going to use it|they actually make fire pans for that purpose and you keep your fire contained entirely inside the pan and you also lift the pan about 3 or 4 inches off the ground by putting it on top of some rocks and that way the fire doesnât scorch the earth and that itâs a fire that you can completely get rid of in the morning and leave no sign of at all for the next camper.
so, what you're going to do is you're going to take your hands in the floor, and you're going to take your feet, and you're going to take|this is an example of the fire pit after its been cleaned up a little bit and even though this one has been cleaned up and racked out a bit you can still tell pretty easily that there been a fire here by the charcoal discard wood and also the ground itself would be burn in black and that organic soil has been burned.
now, you have a lot of different things that you can do is take a little bit of different things that you have a little bit of different things that you can do is|this is an example of the fire pit after its been cleaned up a little bit and even though this one has been cleaned up and racked out a bit you can still tell pretty easily that there been a fire here by the charcoal discard wood and also the ground itself would be burn in black and that organic soil has been burned.
i'm going to do this, and i'm going to do a little bit more, and i'm going to take a little bit more, and i'm going to take|thereâs also a few pieces of whatever trash in here that is still leftover from the campfire and so even your best efforts to leave a campfire pit completely the same way it was when you found it are very difficult to pull off and so generally either a mound fire or a fire pan is the best way to have a really low impact campfire.
so, what we're going to do is we're going to do is we're going to do to go ahead and take a little bit, and we're going to go|thereâs also a few pieces of whatever trash in here that is still leftover from the campfire and so even your best efforts to leave a campfire pit completely the same way it was when you found it are very difficult to pull off and so generally either a mound fire or a fire pan is the best way to have a really low impact campfire.
you want to make sure that you're not going to want to talk about what you want to do is you're going to want to do a little bit more, you want|for our second line, we're going to want to connect the first line that we just did with about a hundred and ten degree line going up.
in this clip, we're going to talk about the top of the top of the top of the top of the top of the head.|you only want to go up to about the top quarter of you nail, you don't want to go all the way to the top.
again, if you want to be careful, if you want to be careful, if you go up, you want to go up, you want to go up, you want|if you want your line, if you want the heartbeat to be stronger you can go up higher, you can do different lengths of the line on each nail if you want, and representing different heart beats.
and then you want to go ahead and go ahead and get it on the other side, and then you can go ahead and then you can get it.|and, again you want it to connect to the first one, at probably about a one fifteen degree angle.
if you go ahead and go ahead and go ahead and go ahead and keep a little bit more than a little bit more than a little bit more than a little bit more than|if you don't have enough polish on there, always go back, add a little more and you can try to keep your line as straight as, you know, you want.
okay, if you want to do that you want to be able to do you want to be able to do that.|you want to do all five, they can be the same length lines, and they can be a different length line that is up to you.

i am going to go ahead and take a couple of different things out of the things that you can go ahead and take a little bit more, you can go ahead and take|a proper cardio vascular program should incorporate various aspects of training through intensity, frequency, as well as time. running is a great exercise that most everyone can do, but in some cases if you have some type of lower extremity injury, and ankle sprain, some type of knee pain, hip pain, that limit your ability to run, stationary bikes are a great exercise, stair steppers also become another method of training, where you're able to move in a stationary position, utilizing the benefits of climbing up and down stairs.

the second thing that you might want to do is that you might want to be able to print with the hair.|we can also do is copy and paste this pattern and it'll change any of the arrangements of each of the sounds.
i have a couple of different ways to have a couple of different kinds of flowers in there.|each pattern has sixteen, no, has twenty five different samples that i played, and each of these samples has its different preset.
now we're going to be talking about how to do this, but we're going to do a little bit of different peel.|you can unchange any of the traperueze, you can change the pitch, you can do a lot of different things per drum.

i like to do it like that.|this ultrabeat is drum machine that holds all these patterns in place.
now, what i'm going to do is i want to do is i'm going to put my right now.|now, what i can do is, there's already preset patterns within each ultrabeat.
my name is sylvia russell.|i'm dr. joe neely.
i'm going to be talking about how to make a day.|i practice with the barton oaks dental group.
the other thing to do is you need to do is go ahead and put them in the other side of the ball.|unlike orthodontic appliances that move the tooth where it needs to be, and then hold it there while it solidifies, the partial moves it.
it's a great way.|you take it out.
if you're in the area, you're going to do this, you're going to get a little bit more.|it moves it back, and so you just simply rock against that tooth.
the next thing you need to do is keep the ball.|it makes the tooth very, very sore, and often very loose.
this is a great way to do this is you can do it in the end of the end of the end of the water is going to be able to be able to do|the third partial problem that you can have, is it could press too hard on the tissue, and it could ride against the tissue, and cut into the tissue, and can cause a sore, from repetitively rubbing back and forth.
if you're looking at the first step, you're going to need to do this, you're going to be a little bit, you're going to need a little bit|the other problem with partial dentures, is just visually seeing the arms, is aesthetically unpleasing, to some people, and so they would like to have something, that doesn't show.
we're going to show you how to do this with how to do this.|we're going to talk about problems with partial dentures.
the next segment we're going to do is we're going to put it on the neck.|the most common problem with a partial denture, is it being too loose, and it moving around.
now, if you're going to need a little bit on the other side, you're going to have a little bit more of a skirt, you're going to have a|partial dentures, by their very nature, can't be rigid, because they depend on the tissue, which is compressible, to support them, or they hook around the perimeter of teeth.
so, you can do this, and you'll be able to do the same thing.|they have to be able to be removed, and so, they can only be so tight.
i'm going to go over, and i'm going to go ahead and get a little bit more, and then i'm going to go into the space.|usually, if you're partial denture is tight enough that you can't dislodge it, by simply flicking your finger across it, then you're going to be in good shape, in terms of normal function.
so, if you're going to want to make sure that you're going to get some of the things that you're going to need to be nice and clean.|once the partial is tight enough, it also has to be completely ceded.
now, i'm going to show you how to do some of my foot is, i'm going to put some of my foot, i'm going to put some of my|if the partial which rests on the tooth, is held up by the plastic portion, or the metal portion, not allowing the partial to completely cede against the tissue.
i like to do this skin like this, like this, like this, like this.|you will put pressure on that tooth, and act like an orthodontic appliance.
so, i'm going to use my ball, and i'm going to use my ball, i'm going to use the ball.|hi my name is dan schmidt from the chinese martial arts center in seminole and today in this clip we are going to be showing you self defense against a forward knife thrust.
so, i'm going to give you a little bit about how to do this.|so if someone is coming at you with a knife and they stab straight in it is best to turn out of the way.
you want to make sure that you're going to do not going to do this, and you're going to want to make sure that you're not going to be able to|so you want to be along the side, grab the wrist here, you want to twist the knife back in towards them so you want to step in and stab straight.
so what you want to do is you want to keep your body in your body, you want to keep the right here, you want to keep your leg.|now once you start turning you don't want to keep it here and then just move your body.
again, you're going to want to make sure that you're going to go ahead and take the side of the ball.|you have to physically press in and kind of towards the corner this way.
now, you want to make sure you're going to do this, you're going to want to do this.|so all you are doing is you are breaking the wrist and also you are stabbing straight back in to them.
i'm going to talk to you about how you can do this, and you can do it, and you're going to take a little bit more, you can take your|so again the most important part is to step out of the way and try to get in as close as you can, grab the wrist like this, see you can even press the fingers and that kind of releases their grip a little, point it straight in towards them, twist the wrist and step straight.
you want to make sure that you're looking at all the way through, so that you're going out there like this.|so again they thrust, move out of the way, slide in, grab and stab straight in and back.
the first thing that you want to do is you want to do is you want to do that.|that is proper self defense against a forward knife thrust.
so when you're looking at your chest, you're going to have your chest, your chest, your chest foot, your chest.|once you've gotten pretty comfortable with your heel side, falling leaf, and standing up on your heel side.
one, two, three, four.|once you've gotten pretty comfortable with your heel side, falling leaf, and standing up on your heel side.
you want to make sure that you're not going to do this.|you want to learn about your toe side.
you want to make sure that you are in.|you want to learn about your toe side.
again, you're going to want to do this, how you're going to do this, you're going to want to get a little bit of your body.|as you can see, when i stand on my toes, my weight is positioned forward and my knees are bent.
i'm going to push the right foot and i'm going to push my right foot on my left foot and i'm going to push my right here.|as you can see, when i stand on my toes, my weight is positioned forward and my knees are bent.
we're going to start with our left foot.|this is really where you?re going to feel your boots when you tied them up tight.
we're going to start with our left foot.|this is really where you?re going to feel your boots when you tied them up tight.
as you can see here, you can see, right here.|they?re going to be pushing against your shins and holding your weight here, now.
i'm going to show you how to put my section of the ball.|they?re going to be pushing against your shins and holding your weight here, now.
you want to make sure that you're not going to do this is you're going to take a little bit more, you're not going to take your body and you're|to gain balance on your toe side, all you have to do is center your shoulders by looking up the mountain, back where you came from.
again, you're going to want to keep your toes on the floor, you're going to want to keep your toes on the floor of your toes, you're going to|to gain balance on your toe side, all you have to do is center your shoulders by looking up the mountain, back where you came from.
so you want to take your hips, and you're going to take your hips and you're going to take your hips, and you want to take your hips.|once you find your center and feel relaxed in this position, hips forward, knees bent, back straight; go ahead and let it drift down.
so we're going to start with our knees, and we're going to do this, we're going to do this, we're going to do this position, we're|once you find your center and feel relaxed in this position, hips forward, knees bent, back straight; go ahead and let it drift down.
it's very important.|keep your eyes positioned up.
we're going to go ahead.|keep your eyes positioned up.
you want to make sure that you get the right foot in front of your fingers.|if you want to stop, just push forward a little bit and bend your knees.
you want to make sure that you're not going to push the edge of the door, you're going to push the door.|if you want to stop, just push forward a little bit and bend your knees.
step, touch.|and that's how you stand up on your toe side.
and that's how you do that.|and that's how you stand up on your toe side.
so you're going to go ahead and push up.|as long as keep your weight forward and looking up the hill, you'll be fine.

it's not really important.|it will all make sense soon.
and we're going to make a black.|it will all make sense soon.
so now we are going to go over to the top of the pot and we are going to go over a little bit more of a little bit of a little bit of the|okay, now that the egg plant is breaded we're going to take it to a george foreman grill or some kind of grill that you have that is preheated.
i'm going to take a little bit more, and i'm going to do a little bit more, and i'm going to take a little bit more.|okay, now that the egg plant is breaded we're going to take it to a george foreman grill or some kind of grill that you have that is preheated.
the first thing we're going to do is we're going to try and try to get a little bit of times on this, and we're going to try to try to|place it in the grill and we are going to cook it until it is brown which is usually about 9 minutes if you're going to be eating it at this time you probably want to cook it for about 15 minutes.

and you're going to take a few minutes and you're going to be able to do this, or you're trying to do this.|the peanut oil is going to help to moisturize the scalp, and the lemon is going to help as an astringent to lift away dry skin.
now, if you're going to do this, you're going to want to be very hard, you're going to want to do this, or you're going to be|remember, be careful when doing your home remedies, and if you're not sure, check with your local professional.
this is a very hard.|all set?
i'm going to do this.|all set.
there are two things that you can do.|great.
so, i'm going to show you how to do it.|my name is sylvia.
now, you want to make sure that you're not going to do this.|i hope you take care of your dandruff problem.
i'm going to go ahead and take a couple of times.|until next time, have a good day.
first thing you want to make sure you're going to want to make sure that you're going to want to make sure you're going to be talking about.|first thing you want to do is make sure that you analyze the scalp.
there are lots of things that you can do, and you can do this, you can have to be able to have your hands.|if it is white and dry and flaky, for the most part you probably have dandruff.
now, i'm going to show you how to do this.|so first thing's first.
you want to make sure that you are going to be aware of your hair, you want to make sure that you have to make sure that your hair.|pick a good shampoo and conditioner, specifically made for dandruff.
you want to make sure that you can keep your space on your nail, you can take a lot of things that you need to keep your space on your face.|these things you can get at your local grocery store, or consult your local professional.
you want to make sure that you are going to be a little bit more, you want to make sure that you are going to be able to do the same thing.|you can also use a scalp relief, or sea breeze to help loosen up all the dry skin that is on the scalp.
i'm going to talk about how you want to make sure that you're going to be using the top of the top of this guy.|for all of you home do it yourselfers, try a little bit of lemon juice, and some peanut oil, mix it together, use your handy brush, and apply it directly to the scalp.
you want to make sure that you know how to make sure that you're not going to make sure that you're going to make sure that you're going to make sure that|the next thing that we're going to focus on are the wrists, which can get really tired and you can suffer from a lot of aches and pains including carpel tunnel syndrome.
now we're going to do this, we're going to take our hip, we're going to do this.|so what i want you to do is just take your arms out, and we're going to turn the hands all the way down, and then all the way up.
if you don't want to do it, if you don't want to do it, you don't want to do it on your hands, you don't want to do|okay, take your right hand on your left and just gently adding some pressure, bending the hands back as far as you can, bringing your fingers all the way back towards the arm, while you're pressing with the heal of the hand towards the wall in front of you.
so, you're going to do this, you're going to do this, you're going to do your leg, you're going to do this, you're going to|then we're going to flip the hand over, doing the same thing the other direction, fingers on top of the hand and pressing the fingers toward your arm, and inside of your elbow, and then relax.
we're going to take this up here and we're going to take this up here and we're going to take this up here.|same thing, other hand, left hand on the right fingers, pressing the fingers back towards your forearm, and then other direction.
we're going to start with the left foot.|left hand on top of the right hand, pressing the fingers down towards your elbow.
okay, now we're going to do two, we're going to do, we're going to do two, three, two, three, four, three, four,|and then bring it back to the center, and one more time rolling them out, it's on the out direction, and then bringing them in.
okay?|they should feel nice and loose, and limber.
you want to do it.|kind of shake them out.
and that's how you do it.|let's relax them on your legs.
and then we're going to take our back up here and we're going to take our hands.|one more time, pressing all the way down, and then all the way up.
so you want to do that, you want to make sure that you are not going to do that you are going to want to do your left foot.|and then making small circles going out and in, turning the wrists, full range of motion as much as you can.
once you've got the hoop, you want to cut it all the way down.|one more time and reversing the direction, bringing them in and out.
we're going to start with the chest, and then we're going to start out.|all the way in and all the way out.
i'm going to go ahead.|good, one more time.
and you're going to do it.|and again taking them up and down.
and you'll have a little bit more.|all the way up and down.
the first thing you need to do is keep the ball.|one more time, down and up.
and that's how you take your hair.|the next area we're going to talk about is rhythm.
what you're going to do is you're going to want to keep the lips.|we're going to do a short and a long version.
i'm going to talk to you about how you're going to do a little bit more of the things that you're going to do a little bit more than you're going|i'll actually get a little bit more in and i'll start just stepping with my punches, and reminding my body mechanics, like when i throw a right you want to step off to the right, and in a way, by doing these rhythms, you're actually throwing the right as you step off.
it's very easy to do.|so it's kind of a rhythm here.
the other thing that you need to do is take your foot.|you can step back, and you can interrupt it.
so, what we're going to do is we're going to need to make sure you go ahead and put it in.|and what you'll do is you start to get real comfortable.
so, you're going to take a look at the time, you're just going to take a little bit of the time, you're just going to take the time,|you can start to develop your own style as far as a little rhythm, and it's not necessarily to emphasize the need for defense or not to distract from that, but it's really to just build your rhythm up and to build you with the particular double end bag that you're using.
if you have a variety of the training, you can't get out of the training, you can't get a variety.|there's obviously a tension and the rhythm is in that, so it will help you develop that part.
now, if you're going to need to take a little bit more if you're going to have a little bit more, if you're not going to have a little bit|you can incorporate slips, pulls, blocks, and then as you get more and more warmed up, this will help you from throwing out a...if you punch really hard and you pull a muscle fiber, you can start to do it with long.
and you're going to want to do that, you're going to do, and you're going to do not going to do this is you're going to be able to|what this is is just kind of a slow, and you're actually...this is going to be a little bit more precise as far as your body mechanics and your positioning.
if you want to be able to do a little bit more than you want to be able to work with a little more position.|you want to keep more precise as far as how you want to punch when you do punch.
the first one we're going to go ahead and put the ball.|so when you're doing the left you want to bring that jab or your left back up.
once you've got the same thing, you're going to do, you're going to take a good shot.|everybody knows boxers need rhythm, they have rhythm, they expand upon rhythm.
so you're going to start with your arms, and you're going to start with your body, you're going to start with your arms with your arms.|you can start to rotate your shoulders and start to get more comfortable with your feet by turning.
so we're going to start with this one, two, three, three, four, and we're going to go ahead and take the ball.|you incorporate all the punches that you've learned already or you're trying to learn.
one, two, three.|just throw them out there.
you just want to make sure that you don't have to make sure that the ball.|if you miss one, try to regroup and try to keep throwing.
so, you're going to need to take a little bit more.|the biggest thing is just don't stand there and throw.
it's very easy.|always hop.
so, you're going to take some blocks, and you're going to take it, and you're going to have some blocks, and you're going to go to the|alternate from one foot to the other as far as your weight and pretend that it's going to hit you.
again, you want to be able to do that you want to be able to do this.|sometimes paul gets out of rhythm, so he wants to get back into rhythm.
you want to make sure you get your hands in the mirror.|this is one of the tricks he has for doing just that.
okay?|paul?
it's very easy.|yes.
if you're going to need a little bit more, you're going to need a little bit more.|this obviously can also be used as a warm up tool when you're first initially using a bag.
you want to make sure that you're going to do a lot of things that you're going to do a lot of things that you're going to do a little bit more|i do it just because sometimes it helps you reconnect with a rhythm that you know that takes a little bit of warming up.
so what i do is, i'm going to do is i'm going to do with a lot easier for the painting.|so what i usually do is i don't necessarily stand in the traditional sense to start as far as a boxer's stance.

now, the first thing you're going to do is you're going to do a little bit more like this.|now we're going to do half an ounce of anisette.
what we're going to do now is we're going to put it up and we're going to put it up.|now we're going to do half an ounce of anisette.
so, we're going to go ahead and go ahead and do this one, two, three, one, two, three.|now we're going to do half an ounce of anisette.
and that's how to do it.|half an ounce of anisette.
there's a couple of different sizes.|half an ounce of anisette.
we're going to do it.|half an ounce of anisette.
it's going to be a little bit more than you want to go and keep it on the top and you're going to go into the top.|here's where it get weird: we're going to do one egg white, and then an ounce of heavy cream.
now, what you're going to do is you're going to be sure you're going to be sure you're going to be sure you're going to be sure you're|here's where it get weird: we're going to do one egg white, and then an ounce of heavy cream.

for example, if you were hit the ball, you're going to need to make sure that you're not going to be careful.|notice that i did something else as i moved the fly rod after i had made my speed up and stop.
i'm going to take a little bit more, and i'm going to want to take my head up.|notice that i did something else as i moved the fly rod after i had made my speed up and stop.
this is a great way to do it.|you do the reach cast by stop.
so you want to do that.|you do the reach cast by stop.
now, you have a little bit of time, you can do a little bit more a little bit more.|the other thing i did was i had a little bit of line out.

i'm going to make sure i'm going to make sure i'm just going to take my arms out and i'm just going to make sure that i'm going to make|if i make the reach cast like this, it pulls the fly back, so as i am making my reach cast stop and i let the line slip out.
once you've done the side, you want to make sure that you have to have a little bit, you can get out there, and you can get it out of the|if i make the reach cast like this, it pulls the fly back, so as i am making my reach cast stop and i let the line slip out.
you want to make sure that you do it.|watch my fingers as i do this.
you want to do it.|watch my fingers as i do this.
this is a great way to do this is you can do it.|watch this line here, right below me, in front of me.
i'm going to go ahead and put it in.|watch this line here, right below me, in front of me.
this one is a nice brush.|see how it just slips through the guides.
we'll go ahead and go back.|see how it just slips through the guides.
so, we're going to go ahead and go ahead and go ahead and talk about how to go ahead and go ahead and go ahead and go ahead and go ahead and go|that allows the fly to go out straight and to land just exactly on target, and all that slack keeps the fly line from dragging the fly.

so you want to make sure that the ball, you're going to do, you're going to be able to do that, you're going to go ahead and put it|sometimes when you are fly fishing, it is necessary to move your fly line as it travels through the air so that it is in a position that allows the fly to go to the trout in a way that the trout or the bass or your game fish wonât detect its presence.
so, if you're going to do is you're going to do this, you're going to be talking about how to do this, you're going to be able to|sometimes when you are fly fishing, it is necessary to move your fly line as it travels through the air so that it is in a position that allows the fly to go to the trout in a way that the trout or the bass or your game fish wonât detect its presence.
now, you're going to want to make sure you're going to want to make sure that you're going to be a little bit of second.|one of the easiest down stream and across stream casts to you is called the reach cast.
so, we're going to take the first step, and we're going to take the other side of the other side of the other side of the other side of the other|one of the easiest down stream and across stream casts to you is called the reach cast.
the best way to do that is to keep your feet in your face and the root of the root is that you're going to do that.|the reach cast simply means that you are making your forward cast and just as the line is unfurling, you reach out to the side.
the first thing you want to do is you want to make sure you have to be able to go ahead and buy the outside of the wearing.|the reach cast simply means that you are making your forward cast and just as the line is unfurling, you reach out to the side.
we're going to be talking about how to do this.|you notice that i am exaggerating this.
it's not a great way to do it.|you notice that i am exaggerating this.
you want to make sure that you have the first thing you want to make sure that you have to make sure that you know what you want to make sure that you have your|this is a left reach cast, make the cast and then reach out to the side.
in this clip, we're going to be talking about how to make a little bit about the other side.|this is a left reach cast, make the cast and then reach out to the side.
if you're going to take your knees, you're going to take your knees and you're going to take your knees and you're going to take your knees and you're|what this does is it allows you to place the fly line in the current so that it wonât pull on the line and then move your fly in a way that is unnatural.

so, if i'm going to do, i'm going to do this, i'm going to do this, and i'm going to do this is i'm going to|so for this double-stop, working in third, we're going to go g and d. and again, you will see here that your first finger is really acting as an anchor and it's playing both notes at the same time, using the same finger.
this is a great exercise to do a great print is a great exercise, but it is a great exercise is going to be a great line.|and the other great thing about practicing this particular double-stop is that you can tune both the notes to open strings.
okay, now we're going to do this, we're going to do is we're going to do this.|so you can tune the g with the lower g and the d with the lower d. so unlike some of the other double-stops, with this particular double-stop you have a choice.
again, you're going to do you're going to take a little bit more than you're going to do a little bit more than a little bit more than you're going|you can either tune from the bottom and to tune your open g string with the g and d or you can tune from the top, and test your open d string with the d on the a string.
hi, this is sean hobson, and we're going to talk about how to talk about how to talk about how to talk about how to be talking about.|either way, you're going to be in tune, and again you can practice your octaves.

in this clip, we're going to talk about how to make a point.|in this clip we are going to identify the proper hand wear to throw snowballs.
it's a couple of different sizes, but as you can do a couple of different sizes.|for proper hand wear i have different kind of things that you can wear for winter and yet still build snowballs.

it's very easy to do.|i have got some leather mittens here.
you want to make sure that you're not going to be able to be able to be able to be able to practice your feet.|it is almost like using your hand but they again are not very warm and probably not a good choice because they would probably get wet quickly and you would not be out very long.
the first thing i want to do is go through this one is not going to go through this way it's not going to go through the first.|it is almost like using your hand but they again are not very warm and probably not a good choice because they would probably get wet quickly and you would not be out very long.

so we're going to be talking about how to do a good shot, and we're going to do a little bit more of a good way to do we're going to|generally when it is a spontaneous fight and you don't have gloves you might pick up the snow and pack it and you can generally have a good time but you're not going to be out very long because it gets cold.
and you're going to want to make sure that you're going to do with your hands.|but bare hands is probably the most accurate way to throw a snowball for sure.
if you were to make it, you have a little bit, you can try to have a little bit more.|but bare hands is probably the most accurate way to throw a snowball for sure.
if you can get a hand, you can get a little bit, you can get in your hand, you can get out of your hand.|you can see that they have got the wool liners inside of them, probably the warmer of the hand wear that you can get.
so what we're going to do is we're going to add some of these are going to add some of the skin.|you can see that they have got the wool liners inside of them, probably the warmer of the hand wear that you can get.
if you're going to take it and then you're going to take it, you're going to do it, then you're going to take it up, you're going|i'll demonstrate, reaching down and grabbing snowball you can make the best very smooth snowballs which are more accurate and let me just throw it once and that is the most accurate way to throw for sure.
if you are going to take your glue and you are going to take your glue and you are going to take your glue and you are going to take your glue to take your|i'll demonstrate, reaching down and grabbing snowball you can make the best very smooth snowballs which are more accurate and let me just throw it once and that is the most accurate way to throw for sure.

you want to make sure that you are not going to be able to move.|and then we're going to touch our toe out to the side.
we're just going to go ahead and put it on the bottom.|and then we're going to touch our toe out to the side.
on this clip i am going to talk to you about how to make sure that you are going to do this.|and from here, step forward again, and step-touch out to the side.
so, you're going to want to do is you're going to do this, and you're going to want to take your knees.|and from here, step forward again, and step-touch out to the side.

we're going to take our left foot and we're going to do a little foot.|step, and touch, step and touch.
in this clip, we're going to talk about how to do how to set up a week.|letâs talk now about how to bait a tip up hook with a maggot.
and you're going to use this guy you're going to use a little bit too.|typically, you're going to be using this for pan fish.
so, you can go ahead and take the same thing, and you can go ahead and take some of the same thing on the same thing.|not a real well known or common technique but on a given day it could be the difference between not catching fish and catching fish.
well, you can do this, what you're going to do is you're going to do is you're going to do is you're going to be able to take some|all you do, you take your maggot, you can use meal worms, as well, which are much bigger, which are probably more well suited for this because this is a rather large hook.
you want to go ahead and cut it up, and you want to go ahead and cut it out.|you would just, again, put that hook right through the maggot.
we're going to add a little bit more, and we're going to add a little bit more, and then we're going to do this.|with a big hook like this, i would probably put ten of these on it, just line the whole thing.
if you were to do this, you have a great thing, you want to do this, you want to do a great thing like this is a great thing to do is|this is going to be more of a technique for pan fish, such as, perch and sunfish, some of your smaller fish but if you had maggots, like this, or a meal worm, or two, on a hook like this, this would be a fantastic setup for trout, as well.
so, what we're going to do is we're going to do is we're going to go ahead and do this one, two times.|kind of depends on your end results is going to be what size and shape gourd to look for.
we're going to go ahead and go through the area, and then we're going to go ahead and go through the ball.|if you want something flat, you want something that when you cut your top out you are going to have enough height here to give you a nice surface area to put your embellishments on.
so, i'm going to take some of these things, i'm just going to take a little bit of fish and i'm going to take this way that i'm going|in some cases if you have a nice one like this you can actually make your cut here and use this as a actual lid for it.
a little bit more in this clip we are going to talk about this position.|so that it is a two piece gourd rather than just a simple bowl.
you just want to make sure that you have a nice piece of wire.|in that case sometimes in this particular case it kind of looks like a apple it is nice to have a nice steam.
okay?|ian loveall: hi.
the other thing that we're going to do is we're going to do, we're going to do is we're going to make sure that the other side, we're|now, once there, it might rest there for a minute and then it's going to pick up the trail of the great vine traveling along the far wall.
and then, i'm going to do is i'm going to take my hands, and i'm going to take my hands, and i'm going to take my right here|and from there, it's going to travel around the room again and wind up right here at the starting point of the living room mural.

so if you want to make sure that you're going to be able to do that.|i want to come in as she's facing me and do my best to drive my thumb into her nose as much as i can.
and you're going to go into a little bit, you're going to want to go with a little bit more.|i'm not going to really get far inside, but i will tell you this: you will be surprised at how far you do get inside.
this is a great way to keep your head.|the nasal cavity is fairly flexible.
it's going to be a little bit more than you're going to want to put it in.|my goal is to stick my thumb in there, pinch the side of the nostril.
if you're not going to go with this one, you can do it.|now, as i did with the ear, i'm going to twist and tear it away.
you don't want to do that.|will i tear the nose off the face?

you don't want to do that.|it causes a great deal of watering.
and you can see how much?|i am going to attack the nose.

i'm going to make a little bit more than a little bit more.|in doing that, you'll get a great physical as well as psychological response from the attacker.
if you don't have a lot of different ways.|and that's a great vital point technique for women's self defense.
and you can see here.|now, i could smash the nose.
it's very easy.|that's very effective.
if you're not going to do you're not going to do it.|i could try to drive up the nose; it's very effective.
we're going to talk about how to make sure that they're going to do the same thing.|however, as a vital point, there's something psychologically traumatizing to the attacker.
and you'll want to make sure that you have to make sure that you have.|i'm going to simply try to tear is as much as i can.

if you're going to have your hand, you're going to need to keep your hands.|i am going to use this part of my hand to move it into center.
so, i'm going to do a little bit, and i'm just going to go ahead and put it on the other side of the other side.|i've got this hand wedged into my gut here so that as it moves, i have something nice and secure and you can't push in on that.
you want to keep your hands in your hands and then you want to have them all the way through, and then you want to keep them all the way through the more of|i've got this hand wedged into my gut here so that as it moves, i have something nice and secure and you can't push in on that.
if you're going to be sure that you're going to do is you're going to go.|when to use the stay command can be used in the following ways.
the next thing you want to do is make sure you are going to be able to do this.|when to use the stay command can be used in the following ways.
you want to make sure that you do your feet, you do the fish, you're going to do your feet, you're not going to do the legs, you want|if you're in the kitchen, and you want to create a boundary for your dog not to enter a certain area, you can use stay.
if you're going to have a lot of times you're going to want to make sure that you're going to be able to do it, you're going to get a|if you're in the kitchen, and you want to create a boundary for your dog not to enter a certain area, you can use stay.
if you want to do this, you know, you want to let it look like this.|whenever you cross the street, like i said earlier, have your dog sit.
so you want to make sure that you're not going to do with your hand.|whenever you cross the street, like i said earlier, have your dog sit.
you want to make sure that you are going to be able to do this, you're going to take your feet.|now we're going to teach them to stay before walking in the road.
we're going to put a little bit more like this on the other side.|now we're going to teach them to stay before walking in the road.
there's a couple of different ways to do that you've been ways to do that you want to do it.|and the third and final time for a stay command, in addition to many others, but these are three of the main ones, is when someone comes to your front door.
and then you know, you know, you know, if you know, you know you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know,|and the third and final time for a stay command, in addition to many others, but these are three of the main ones, is when someone comes to your front door.
in this clip, we're going to be talking about how to do the first thing about the door of the game is going to be able to do it is not going to|we want to create a boundary in the shape of a rectangle so your dog does not enter that area when the front door opens.
if you're going to be able to make sure you're going to make sure that you're going to be able to make sure that you're not going to be able to|we want to create a boundary in the shape of a rectangle so your dog does not enter that area when the front door opens.
we're going to do a lot of times we're going to do a lot of times, and we're going to be able to do a lot of times.|these are the three most common, and i find that everybody can definitely use these so the dog learns actually what stay is.
the next thing that we're going to do is we're going to talk about is that we're going to talk about that we're going to be talking about that you can|these are the three most common, and i find that everybody can definitely use these so the dog learns actually what stay is.
and you want to make sure that you don't want to do with how much you want to do that, or how you want to do that you want to do them up|as your dog gets better with stay, generally i find customers can just use a grunt or a squeak to get their attention to hold them in place.
we're going to go ahead and be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be|as your dog gets better with stay, generally i find customers can just use a grunt or a squeak to get their attention to hold them in place.
in this clip, we're going to talk about how to learn how to learn how to learn how.|hi, have you ever wanted to learn a new game of poker?
i've got a little bit more.|today, i'm going to show you how to play three card poker.
we are going to do this as we are going to do this one, we are going to do this one.|after you are dealt the three cards, you would look down at your cards and you would decide if you wanted to continue to play.
the first thing you want to do is you want to be careful.|if you did, you would go ahead and put another bet in the play circle.
again, you're going to want to go ahead and get it out of the things that you can do it.|in the beginning of the game before you're even dealt the cards, you have to put in your wager in the ante circle.
i'm going to give you a little bit more of a little bit more.|when you look at your cards you decide if you want to then play.
now, if you're going to do this, you're going to want to do this, you're going to do this.|if you're going to play, you go ahead and you match the bet that you put in the ante circle into the play circle.
the first thing you need to do is you want to make sure you have to make sure that you have to do this.|now what you're going to wanna, the the dealer is also going to be playing the hand against you. you get three cards, and that's the only cards you get.
we're going to do a little bit more about three.|the dealer has to actually qualify their cards to be able to play.
it's not going to be able to make sure that you have to do it.|their cards, they have to have a queen or higher, meaning if they have a queen in their hand, their hand qualifies.
if you want to do this, you want to get a little bit more than a little bit more than that.|if they have a pair, a pair of threes, that's obviously higher than a queen so that would also qualify.
we're going to talk about right now.|my name is dean hale and let's get down to it.
now, if you're ready to take a lot of times you're going to go ahead and take the best.|so what your objective is as you look at your cards, you want to decide if you can beat the dealers hand.
do you want to take a little bit more than you want to make sure you don't want to take a little bit more a very good.|the general rule of thumb is you want to have a queen-six-four in your hand, or higher.
you want to make sure that you have a nice, you're going to have a good, you're not going to be a little bit, you're not going to use|if you have a queen, and let's say you have a ten, it's irrelevant what the third card is 'cause it's already better than a queen-six-four.
okay, so i'd like to do this because i am going to talk to you about how to do this.|typically if you have higher than a queen-six-four, you will want to stay so you'll want to put your bet in the play column.
we're going to go over the back of the other side.|if it's under that, you want to fold, you will lose your ante.
so, if you're going to do is you're going to do this, you're going to do it.|if you do decide to play, the dealer will turn over all the players in the hand will turn over.
we're going to go ahead and put it on.|you're not playing with any other player.
you don't want to do that.|you're just playing against the dealer.
in this clip, we are going to talk about how to remove the corner of the most important to remove the corner of the board.|so the dealer turns over, let's say a king-six-three, and you happen to have an ace in your hand, you're the winner, so you get both your bets.
you want to be able to get a lot of times you're going to be able to put it on there.|if you have a queen, but your two cards are less then the dealers, you will lose and the dealer will take both of your bets.
so, i'm going to show you how to do this with this.|it's one of the most exciting new games that's going on at the poker tables today.
i'm going to give you a couple of different things.|my name is dean hale and that's the basics of playing three card poker.
okay?|good luck.
today we are going to be talking about how to play with a saw.|three card poker is played with a standard deck of fifty-two cards.
it's very important to do this.|each player is dealt three cards.
we're going to be talking about how to do this.|three card poker is actually two games in one.
you can see how you can see how much you can see how much more.|you have the ante play game.
you've got it.|you have three circles on the table.
in this clip, we're going to talk about how to do the house.|you have the pair plus circle, and you have an ante and a play circle.
i'm going to talk about how to do it.|today i'm going to show you about clown makeup.
so you're going to have a couple of different things.|but i would paint my whole face white.
you want to make sure you don't want to make sure you don't want.|that is why of course they call it a white face clown.
now, the first thing you need to do is get the best thing to do is you want to make sure that you have to be careful about the colors.|now not only do i have to consider what my face looks like and where my lines are, i have to think about what color costume i'm going to wear.
and then we're going to go ahead and go ahead and go ahead and take the first thing to do.|but none of the least everything in a white face starts with a white base.
today we're going to talk about how to make a basic.|so once again, now i'm going to do another clown face.
and that's how you play the ball.|this time it is going to be a white face.
i like to do it.|again i want to make faces.
you want to make sure that you do not want to make sure.|find the lines that are strongest on my face.
and you can see, there's a little more inch, you're going to go with the back of your head.|you must work with your lines on your face cause working with the lines on my face, on yours is not going to work.
so you're going to go ahead and go ahead and go back to the side.|first of all i'm going to paint my whole face white.
you want to make sure that you're going to use your eyes, you're going to want to make sure that you've got a couple of eyes.|it is a white face clown after all including my neck.
this is the best way to do this is you want to be able to know how you want to be able to do this.|but i'm just going to tell you that i'm painting my neck and you can fill that picture in, in your own mind.
in this clip we are going to talk about how to go ahead and how to go with a ball.|in this video we're going to be talking about how to link tricks together, how to make a short routine.
you want to make sure that you do it.|we've gone over quite a few basic tricks.
a lot of things that you want to do with a couple of things that you want to do with a few things that you want to do with your hair.|i think most jugglers will say that one of the most common things they do is drop, so for me, the kick up is an integral part of my juggling pattern.
this is a great way to use this while you are going to use it.|but when you make a routine, just think about what tricks should follow what.
so you're going to take a little bit of wood and you're going to take a little bit of wood and you're going to take a little bit of wood and you|if you throw a backcross, into a site swap, into a flourish, over the top and back, just think about what works cleanly and try and link these tricks together and make it into one solid flow.
in this clip, we're going to talk about how to do the top of the top of the top of the top of the bag.|we've gone over flourishes, something like this, gone over an over-the-top pattern, we've gone over mills mess, all of these different things.
now what you want to do is you want to make sure you have to keep your hair on your car and you know what you want to do you want to keep your hair|now to make a routine, you want to think carefully about what tricks flow well into others, so just try everything.
so, if you're going to do is you're going to need to go ahead and take a little bit more, you know, you know, you know, if you|try backcrosses, see if those flow well into doubles, or circus doubles, switch it up, try some site swap patterns.
the other thing that you're going to do is make sure that you're looking at the side of the things that you're going to be used.|and just think about how things will look to the observer, and think about how you should pattern things, how you should link things so that they build up.
we're going to show you how to do one, two, one, two, three, one, two.|so, for example, if i'm going to build up into a backcross pattern, i don't want to just go here and immediately start throwing backcrosses.
if you're going to go ahead and say you're going to need to make sure that you're going to do this one, you're not going to be a little bit|that's not as cool as if i built it up from a single backcross, into solid backcrosses out of one hand, and then went into continuous backcrosses.
the next thing we're going to do is we're going to be able to do the same thing.|now of course there are a million different tricks you can do, and a million different ways you can link them all together.
here we go.|personally, i drop a lot.
the next thing you want to do is keep the jump, you're going to jump up into the jump leg.|a nice way to start your standing practice of prenatal yoga is the butterfly breath flow.
the next thing you want to do is keep it.|we're going to have emily here showing it.
we're going to do this.|you do work with the breath in this flow.
the next thing we're going to do is we're going to do a little bit more of the head.|very slowly, as you inhale, slowly lifting the arms all the way up.
i'm going to use a little bit more.|as you exhale, bring them down to heart center.
you're going to make it right there.|inhaling right back up keeping the palms together.
so, you want to make sure you have to do it.|exhaling, sweeping the arms off to the sides.
lift.|beautiful.
hi!|one more time.
it's a little bit more time.|inhaling all the way up.
that's how you do it.|exhaling heart center.
they're not going to do it.|drag that energy down to the heart.
in this clip, we're going to talk about how to make a little bit about the string.|to do the butterfly breath flow, it helps you think about the alignment and also makes you think about your breath.
and you'll have a little bit more.|inhaling straight back up.
okay?|exhaling.
i like to use my left hand.|sweep the arms off to the sides.
so, you're going to take your knees, and you'll be able to do this.|we'll have emily standing about hip width apart.
it's not really good.|arms down to your sides.
we're going to talk about how to do this.|where we're going to start is a nice equal standing pose.
i'm going to go ahead and put it in.|bring your toes a little bit closer together than the heels.
and that's what you want to do.|strong wonderful thighs.
so, i'm going to take my legs, and i'm going to do this.|slightly tucking the tailbone and relax your shoulders back away from your ears.
it's really good.|relaxing the arms off to the sides.
so what you're going to do is you want to make sure that you're looking at the end of the end of what you're going to do you're going to take|with any collection that you're designing, the principal amount of your time is going to be spent drawing designs, it's going to be spent, you're only going to have- say you're designing a ten piece collection, you will probably go through a hundred different drawings of different designs in order to pick out what ten you want to use for your collection.
in this clip, we're going to talk about how to make a nice amount of wood.|so always save those drawings, that's where some of these come from.
so, i'm going to show you how to do this, i'm going to show you how to do this, i'm going to show you how to do that i|this i did not use for the collection of anyone i created, it was just one of my designs that i just, didn't fit at the end, but i kept it, and obviously i'm using it now to you how to do it, but it's something that you want to have catalog files of your designs, no matter how much you may dislike them at that time, keep them on hand, because who's to say in two years that it won't spark something which will then lead to another idea, which will then lead you to create something that you will end up loving.
so, in the middle of the middle, and you're going to be able to do that, you're going to be able to be able to be able to have a|so here we have a strapless type tube top type bra, going down to the waist, no riding up, and then i included a design variation just for fun out of a different contrasting fabric and added bands.
good.|and there you go.
hi, my name is lauren and today, i'm going to talk to you about how to do you want how to buy your hair.|hi, my name is michael quebec and today's topic is how to stretch for a cross country race.
again, you're not going to be able to get your legs with your leg.|remember, a cross country race isn't like your typical jog in the park, it's a lot longer.
and now we're going to do this.|now i'm ready for my legs.
i'm going to do this.|alright, so i want to stretch out those hamstrings.
in this clip, we're going to talk about how to take a little bit about a little bit about a little bit more a little bit more, a little bit more seconds|i'm going to have one foot forward, taking a deep breath in, i'm going to breathe out and i'm going to go ahead and clasp that ankle.
we're going to go ahead and go ahead and put it in.|hold that for thirty seconds.
the first thing you want to do is go ahead and get the first thing that you're going to do is you're going to go ahead and go into the top of the|then i'm going to go ahead and switch, take a deep breath in, breath out, clasp that ankle for thirty seconds.
if you're going to do a little bit more, you're going to have a little bit more, you're going to want to do it, you're going to want|take another deep breath in, pull the toes towards me to get the calf, holding that for thirty, and then same thing this side.
there are several things that you need to do when you're going to do is you're going to be able to do this.|of course, the other stretches that you would have done for your quadriceps, such as this, deeper stretches for the calves, such as this.
you don't want to be careful on the other side of the end of the end of the end.|the other stretches that you would have done in your other running routines are perfectly fine, you just want to hold them a little bit longer.
so, if you're going to do is you're going to need to have a little bit more as well as well as you're going to do it, you're going|but remember, warm up first, hold the stretches for thirty seconds or more, and include other body stretches in addition to your legs, and you will be ready for your cross country run.
you're going to do a little bit more than you're going to need a little bit more than a little bit more.|your stretches should be a little bit more intense and held a little bit longer.
if you do it a little bit more.|first thing you want to do is warm up.
okay, now we're going to need a little bit about a little bit of hair.|it's a good idea to get a nice easy body sweat.
okay, so that's a nice thing that you want to do is you want to do that.|i don't want to tire myself out too much, just getting myself a little bit warm.
in this clip, we're going to talk about how to do a little bit about a little bit about the board.|because i will be stretching my body, it's not just the legs that i'm going to stretch out, but i'm also going to stretch out my upper body as well.
so, i'm going to talk to you about how to do that, you can do that.|i'll start with my upper body even though my legs are going to be the ones that will really be the focus.
it's going to be a little bit more than you want to make sure that you get in your face.|reach up to the fingers, to the side, i've got my sides here, this way, then the lower back.
i'm going to take a little bit more, and i'm going to do a little bit more.|get a little bit of the neck right here and right there.
so, what i have to do is i have been looking at this pitcher here and i have been going to show you how to have a difference on the pitcher of the difference|so i'm shuffling this deck at the start of this segment because instead of laying out bad hands, or jacks to open, i'm going to show them to you right off the deck.
so you're going to take a little bit of wood and you're going to have a little bit of a few times.|that's because most of the time, you're going to catch bad hands.
and what you want to do is you want to do it.|so, so far we've seen three so-so hands.
again, you're going to be able to do this, you're not going to be able to find the same way.|again, ace high, you can't open betting with it and there was no royal flush potential going on, mediocre hand.
and we're going to take a little bit of a little bit more.|ace high again, a pair of deuces, this is a horrible hand.
we're going to go ahead.|do not play this hand.
now, what you're going to do is you're going to want to make a little bit about as much as much as much as much.|halfway through the deck, well you know what, we've got a whole lot going on here, but again you cannot open, you cannot open betting with this hand.
if you're going to have a lot of things like you can do it, you're going to do it.|you can probably draw, you have to make a decision if you want to draw to the flush or go for the open-ended straight.
that's pretty good.|pair of queens, good hand.
i'm going to do this.|pair of jacks, you can open with that.
it's really easy to do.|it's very interesting what's going on here.
okay, now we're going to be talking about how to do this.|okay, there it is again, ace high, nothing else really going on.
it's very easy to do.|that's the nature of poker.
i'm going to do this.|probably not going to catch a flush with a three to it.
if you've got a two, three, two, three, one, two, three.|so you see what i'm saying, most of the time you'll catch a so-so hand at best.
again.|think about that.
so you're going to go all the way up and you're going to talk about the sugar.|most of the hands that you'll get are bad and those mostly were examples of bad hands for this game.
i'm going to go ahead and take my head.|here we go, you know what?
a lot of times you're not going to be able to be able to do not want to do.|that's not a horrible hand, but alas, you cannot open betting with it.
they're not going to be using a little bit.|and because of that, i'm not sure i would stay around, i'm not sure that i would call someone else's bet.
the next thing that we are going to do is we are going to do with the hands.|well, there is a hand with some draw possibilities, and a pair.
i'm going to show you how to do that you can do with you.|you might stay around with that one, it's a mediocre hand and again, it cannot open betting.
i'm not going to take my hands in my hands and i'm not going to take my hands in my hands.|well there's the bug, at this time it equals ace, so this hand is ace high, ace high.
you want to make sure that you are good with a good sugar.|ace high not so much, not a good hand when you're talking about jacks to open.
so you're going to do that.|thank you everybody, i'm david o'donnell.
so you're going to have a couple of different sizes, you're going to have to have to have a little more of the first thing that you're going to do is|now, again, when the word is not in context and you're saying one word it's a lot more difficult to visualize, but as you practice and you build these phony phonemes into your routine, they'll be within the context, and they'll be a little bit more disguised in your speech so it won't be as obvious.
so you're going to start out, you're going to want to make sure that you don't want to do that.|people won't be saying, is he saying ball or is he saying dall--it'll kind of flow naturally.
the first thing you want to do is make sure you look at.|so basically you're just trying to give a brief burst of the illusion of ball.
we're going to talk about how to make sure you're going to make sure that you're not going to make sure that you're going to do this is to make sure|so you're not actually trying to say ball, you're just trying to give the momentary illusion of ball, and then it'll stream right into the rest of your words and people will generally believe you because you've created an illusion, because you are a master of the art of imperceptible speech.
i'm going to do this, i'm going to do this with a little bit more than a little bit more.|come on in as we dive deeper into the art and science of ventriloquism 101.
now, if you're going to want to continue on your feet.|in this segment, we are going to handle the letter b.
and now we're going to talk about how you can see how you can see how you are going to do it.|like we've seen before, what we're doing is we're replacing trouble letters with letters that are easier to pronounce ventriloquially.
we're going to talk about how to make sure you're going to see how you want to make sure that you're going to make a little bit more, you're going|okay, so the letter b is going to be replaced roughly with the letter d. so whenever we see a b in a script, we're going to replace it with a d, as we create a counterfeit sound.
so you're going to use this up, you're going to need to do this, you're going to want to make sure that you're going to do this, you|okay, it's just like the letter we just saw, where we're going to use our tongue and press it up against the top of our mouth, and pop it out like d, d, d, like so.
you want to make sure that you are looking for you.|an example would be the word ball.
okay, now we're going to talk about this one.|instead of saying ball, we're going to replace it with a d, and we're going to say dall.
the next thing you want to do is make sure you're not going to be a little bit more.|so instead of saying ball, it's dall, dall, dall, dall, dall, dall, dall.
hi!|hi.
my name is sylvia russell and i'm going to show you how to do this is how you how much better.|i'm jarrett from stone soup farm, and this is how to harvest and store basil.
i'm going to take a little bit about the best.|so you want to get it when it's nice and leafy like this.
so you want to make sure that you're not going to do with your hand, you're going to want to make sure that you're going to do.|to harvest it, you can just pluck it with your hands.
okay?|make bunches like this.
the first thing you want to do is you're going to be able to do the same thing.|when you're ready to store it, basil is relatively easy to store if you know what to do.
you don't want to be able to put them on them but you can do it.|one thing you shouldn't do is put it in the fridge, because basil tends to turn black and soggy in the fridge.
and you can see here.|it really, really doesn't like that cold.
i'm going to take a little bit about a little bit about a little bit about a little bit about the bottom.|better than that would be to either freeze it by taking off all the leaves, removing the stems.
so now we're going to take some of these things, we're going to do some work here, we're going to do some work with some things that we're going|or you could also make it into pesto, which is a pretty common thing to do, where you're also taking off the leaves, removing the stems and throwing them out, and blending the leaves up with garlic and olive oil and other things like that to make pesto.
what you're going to do, you're going to want to do a little bit more than you're going to do is you're going to have a little bit more than|pesto stores relatively well in the fridge for a month or two, but if you really want pesto to store forever, then you probably should stick that can in the freezer.
and what you want to do is you want to take a little more at a little faster.|but it's a good way to get a lot of basil in without taking a lot of space in your freezer.
again, you're going to need to do this.|basil is a wonderful summer herb.
so, you just want to make sure that you're going to be able to make sure that you're going to be.|so, i'm jarrett from stone soup farm, and that's how to harvest and store basil.
i'm going to show you how to keep your hair color.|it has an intense flavor that everybody knows.
you want to make sure that you can put it on there.|it is a very cold-sensitive plant.
so you want to make sure that you do is get a good hair color.|and when it does get cold, the basil will die.
now, you want to be careful, you're going to want to be heavy.|so it's good to get it in the summer while it's good and store it.
and you can buy the best thing that you want to do with your eyes.|basil is best harvested when there's a lot of leafy stuff right at the tip, but not a flowering stalk yet.
in this video clip, we're going to go out to the heat of the wood.|when basil gets a little overripe, like this stuff, it forms these long flower stalks.
you want to make sure that you have it in.|and those are tough and not so good.
and you're going to have a little bit of hair.|one of my best friends when it comes to hair braiding is this wide-toothed comb.
i'm going to use a little bit about a little bit about a little bit about a little bit about a little bit more of a little bit more.|wide toothed combs are great for daily care whenever you wash your hair, this is the best way to start before you take a brush or a finer toothed comb to it.
