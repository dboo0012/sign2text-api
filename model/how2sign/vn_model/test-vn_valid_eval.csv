and then you want to make sure that you're going to need to keep them as long as well as much as long as much as you need.|we're going to work on a arm drill that will help you have graceful hand movements in front of you.
that's how you do it.|i call it painting the wall.
so, i'm going to demonstrate, i'm going to do a little bit in the middle, and i'm going to take a little bit of the leg, i'm|so we're going to go up and down; let's switch hands, down and up; down and up.
it's not really good.|and just let those fingers relax.
and you'll notice that you are going to be able to do that.|now together you're going to go opposite.
one, two, three, one, two, three, one, two, three; one, two, three.|do it very mechanically at first and then slowly soften it out as you feel comfortable.
and you're going to go ahead and find a good way to do it.|it's real easy to actually get your fingers to lead, so try not to let them do that.
that's going to do it right there.|let the wrist do all the leading.
okay, so we're going to do this, we're going to do this, and we're going to do this, we're going to do that we're going to|so this one what you're going to start with, let's take one hand first; it's going to, the wrist is going to come down and the wrist is going to come up.
and there's a lot of different things that you can do this, and there's a couple of things that you can do that.|so basically your wrist is going to be leading the movement, and let the fingers follow nice and relaxed where the wrist is going.
now, if you're going to do is you're going to want to take your knees.|don't let the fingers take over, let the wrist do all the guiding.
the next step is going to be a little bit more than a number.|let's make sure that are feet are parallel and are knees are soft.
what you're going to do is you're going to go ahead and take your feet up, and you're going to go ahead and put it down.|our belly buttons pulled in pressing in towards our spine and our chest is lifted, and our arms are relaxed; are shoulders are nice and relaxed.
now, you're going to want to make sure that you're doing.|so let's start with the one hand going up and down.
you want to make sure that you are not going to do a little bit more.|we're going to keep this right in front of us; you don't want to have it in front of your face so you block yourself.
i'm going to talk about how to make sure you do this with how to do a group.|you want it right in front of your solar plexus.
in this clip, we're going to talk about how to do the same thing in the same thing for the same thing.|in this clip we are going to talk about dangers for these birds in the household and otherwise.
i'm going to use a little bit more than a little bit more.|the number one loss for these birds, is flight.
and you want to make sure that you have a little bit more like this.|you need to be very careful when cleaning their cages if these birds are flighted.
we're going to go ahead and put it in here.|it seems to be the number one way to loose them.
and we're going to go ahead and do this.|once they get loose outside, predators will get to them very quickly.
if you can do that, you can do that, you can do it, you can get out of the same thing.|these guys are not suited to live in the united states, they are not native here and they don't survive.
so, you want to make sure you've got your dog.|the other dangers you need to worry about, is teflon pans.
there's a lot of different things, but there's a lot of different things that you can get out of different things, but there's a lot of different things that you|if they are heated to a high temperature, they give off some fumes that the birds inhale which causes them basically to fell off their perch dead.
so, i'm going to show you how to do this.|there is nothing that you can do about it and it is very quickly.
you're going to go ahead.|it is kind of a silent killer.
the other thing that we're going to do is we're going to be talking about how to make sure that the other side.|so, if you have them in the kitchen and if you are going to cook with teflon, move them to another room in the house, so that you can protect them.
if you notice you're going to do this is you're going to want to take a little bit more like this, and you're going to do it, you're going|aerosols, spraying for bugs, spraying perfumes around the house, all those sort of things, these birds have very very sensitive upper repository tracts and so if you have any sort of aerosol it can irritate their lungs.
if you're not going to do it, you're going to want to do a little bit more like this.|if these guys are flighted, you need to be really careful if you have them loose in your household.
it's going to be a little bit more like this.|and, these guys only have a few breaths before they'll die.
so, you know what you want to do is you want to know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know.|so you need to be very careful with aerosols around the house.
if you want to do, you want to take a good shot, you want to get a little bit more than a little bit more than that, you want to get a|and lastly, they are so so tiny, basically anything in your house, a dog, a cat, anything, they can get squished in a door, if they get mouthed, even a little tiny bit by your dog or cat, or by your kid, they will just squished.
my name is sylvia russell and i'm going to talk about how to have your dog.|there is not a whole lot to them, they are not that robust, they are mostly feathers.
in this clip, we're going to talk about how to make it.|you have to be fairly careful with these birds.
i have a couple of different things.|at least in a physical way.
so, what you want to do is make sure you're not going to want to make sure that you're going to want to do it.|those are most of your household dangers.
so, if you're going to do is you're going to need to be careful like this.|and again, if you are cooking and the birds are loose, be careful with them landing on a hot pan.
it's very easy to make sure that you have to make sure that you have a little bit of.|you don't want toilet seats open if they are flying around your house because they can fly in it and drowned.
we're going to be talking about how to do a good-five-five-five-up.|just be careful, you want to make sure that if you ever let these guys loose out of their cage, you basically bombproof your house.
we're going to talk about how to do it.|a lot of these birds aren't tame.
so, you want to make sure you don't want to put it in.|you make sure that every little nook and cranny has been looked at for.
okay, as you can see, as you can see, as you can see, as you can see, as you can see, as you can see, as you want|and, if they are alone in their cages and if you have smaller pets and it is a smaller cage, they cannot knock their cage over and let either the bird to fly out or they can't reach through the bars.
my name is sylvia russell and i'm going to show you how to do this is how to make sure that you can get up with your hair.|like a cat might dig through the bars if they are small enough and be able to grab hold of the bird.
and if you have a little bit, you can have a little bit more, you can have a little bit of a little bit more, then you have a little bit of|and, if the bird is outside if you let these guys outside to get some fresh sunshine, raccoons have been known to break into their cages and tear through the bars and ripped into these guys.
if you're using a few different things, you're going to need to do it.|so you have to be very careful if you leave them outside for any period of time.
if you don't want to be able to be able to do it because you don't want to be able to do the same thing for you.|that more or less covers it, just be careful because your birds are very small and much more sensitive to chemicals then many other pets are.
it's not a little bit more.|people get them and they only have two or three of them.
okay, so now we're going to talk about how to make a pass.|as you are opening the cage doors to clean their cages these guys will get startled and fly away.
so, you don't want to make sure you don't have any of these.|and when they panic, they fly and they don't come back.
i'm going to do this.|they fly out your windows.
you want to make sure that you are going to do this.|they fly out your front door.
if you don't have a lot of different things to do not have a lot of different have to have to be able to have a good way to do that you don't|you will be thinking that every thing is sealed and you go clean the papers and your daughter, son, husband walks in through the front door and that bird just flies right out.
so, i'm going to use a little bit, and i'm going to use a little bit, i'm going to use this, i'm going to go ahead and|i hope this becomes very popular, here of late, is the circle hooks. now, circle hooks has been used by japanese fishermen and longliners for years and years, but in recent years, they've developed lighter, smaller, in shore type hooks, which are very well suited, particularly to folks that are in to the hook and release type fishing.
and you're going to want to make sure that you're going to do, you're going to want to be able to do this one.|this hook, basically is designed, to catch the fish in the corner of the mouth.
the next thing we're going to do is we're going to do this, we're going to be able to be able to do this.|now this type of hook, when you get a bite, you can't jerk the rod to set the hook.
if you have a very comfortable, you can get a little bit more, you can get a little bit more, you can get a little bit more, you can get a|you basically just reel down, and get the line tight, and the fish will take off, and when he does, he usually turns, and this hook comes right in the corner of his mouth, and it sort of acts, really like a, kind of like a bottle opener.
so, if you're doing this, you're going to want to get a little bit more of a little bit more, and you're going to have a little bit of|once you get it in there, it is very difficult to remove this hook, so if you catch a lot of fish, when you hook up the fish, you rarely ever lose them because of that particular mechanism.
so if you want to make sure you're going to be able to do this and you're going to do that.|the nice thing about the circle hook is, you don't gut hook a lot of fish.
what you want to do is make sure that you do.|you don't damage a lot of fish.
you want to make sure that you do.|you simply get him up to the boat.
you want to make sure that you are going to be able to be careful because you're going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to|if you want to release him, you can release him, or cut the hook out, and it's a pretty, it's a pretty friendly hook, for fishing.
it's very easy to do.|michael rosengart: thrusters.
i'm going to talk about what i'm going to do is i'm going to be talking about how to do.|right now, we're going to get into a more complicated exercise.
it's not really good.|jonesy is going to sit back.
okay, so now we're going to do is we're going to do is we're going to take our leg, and we're going to go back down to the floor|and as he drives up, again, driving on his heel, driving his hips forward is the work from his hips that will then force the arms up.
okay.|good.
you're going to be talking about your head, and then you're going to be talking about your head.|and then there's a lot of arm strength involved to stabilize the dumbbell right above his shoulders.
we're going to be able to do this.|not out to the side, not back, but right above.
good.|that's good.
it's not really hard.|good work, jonesy.
you want to make sure that you don't want to make sure that you don't have to work with your dog.|again working from the heels up, work with your breath; feel that you're driving your hips forward and up each time, good work.
what you're going to do, you're going to want to make sure that you're going to put your back down.|do ten of those and we're going to take a three to five minute break, and then come back to it.
so you're going to take your feet and you're going to take your feet and you're going to take your feet and make sure that you're going to make sure that|again, i want to make sure that you understand that when you're doing the thruster that it's working from the ground up, and it is one smooth movement.
the next thing that we're going to do is make sure.|we're integrating more of the body.
i'm going to do this.|it's not segmented.
so, i'm going to demonstrate, i'm going to do this right here.|it's not the squat and a shoulder press, okay?
i'm going to do this.|it's one smooth movement.
hi!|try it.
if you're not going to go, you're going to want to make sure that you're going to go through the ball, you're not going to go through.|and we're going to develop more strength because we're getting more of the body parts working together at the same time in cohesion.
okay?|okay.
now, you're going to want to make sure you're going to keep your hair.|so, jonesy, you want to go ahead and show what a thruster is?
i'm going to start on my head, and i'm going to go ahead and bring it down.|jonesy going to take a couple of dumbbells, bring it up to his shoulders.
today we are going to show you how to do this.|and we're, basically, he's going to sit back into a squat.
you want to make sure that you are going to be a little bit more.|and we're basically combining a squat and a shoulder press, but it's not that simple.
one, two, three.|it's not segmented like that.
one of the things that you want to do is get a lot of things that you're going to do is you're going to have any of the hair, you're going|another technique is you can braid the hair on first and then start wrapping cause some people have really short hair and we can create the look with adding the hair end.
now, i'm going to show you how to do this, i'm just going to make a little bit of hair, and i'm just going to show you how to|another technique is you can braid the hair on first and then start wrapping cause some people have really short hair and we can create the look with adding the hair end.
you want to make sure that you are going to do this, you've got to do this, and you want to do this, and you've got a little bit of|so no matter what the length of your hair, long as it's long enough to add a, at the hair on, we can start by braiding it on, then braid, then wrap and you can make this as thick as you like, whatever size you like, whatever color you like.
i'm going to do this, and i'm going to do a little bit more, and i'm going to do a little more of a over, so i'm going|so no matter what the length of your hair, long as it's long enough to add a, at the hair on, we can start by braiding it on, then braid, then wrap and you can make this as thick as you like, whatever size you like, whatever color you like.
and you want to add a little bit of different things that you want to do a little bit of different color.|i like the lock extensions because it's not damaging to your hair at all, because you can add color without actually coloring your hair, you just wrap on a different color.
you want to make sure that you are going to be the same thing, you want to make sure that you are going to be able to do with the same thing with your|i like the lock extensions because it's not damaging to your hair at all, because you can add color without actually coloring your hair, you just wrap on a different color.
okay?|i really like that.
okay?|i really like that.
there are a couple of different things that you can do is you want to do this.|you can get instant length, which i love.
you want to make sure that you do not want to make sure that you do not want to give your hair in your hair.|you can get instant length, which i love.
it's going to be a little bit more than you're going to want to get a little bit of hair color.|and, we have a skinny one and we have a little fatter one.
and you might want to go with more, and you'll go more, and you want to do it with the more of more.|and, we have a skinny one and we have a little fatter one.
that's what you want to do.|and we can them even fatter.
i like to make sure that you do.|and we can them even fatter.
and you need to make sure that you are not going to be able to do.|whatever length, we can just keep on adding hair forever and ever and it will just go on and on.
and then we're going to go ahead and go ahead and go ahead and come up with a little pressure.|whatever length, we can just keep on adding hair forever and ever and it will just go on and on.
we're going to do this.|we can make them as long as we want.
we're going to do this.|we can make them as long as we want.
you want to make sure that you've got a nice ball.|and in this segment, i'm going to just start paint in the background color.
in this clip, we're going to talk about how to do the first thing.|and in this segment, i'm going to just start paint in the background color.
if you're going to be a little bit more, you're going to be a little bit more, you're going to be talking.|i'm going to start on the edge so i can get the edge painted in against the skyline.
if you're not going to do you have a little bit, you can do it, you can do it, you're not going to try to do it with a little|i'm going to start on the edge so i can get the edge painted in against the skyline.
so you're going to have to have a little bit of these things that you're going to have a little bit of water and you're going to have a little bit of|i'm just doing a dark hill here.
okay, so you can see, you're going to have a little bit a little bit of this while you're going to get out of the water.|i'm just doing a dark hill here.
i've got a little bit more than a little bit more here.|i'm trying to define the edges and then kinda just dry-brush it to fill it in a little bit.
you want to make sure that you're not going to go down.|i'm trying to define the edges and then kinda just dry-brush it to fill it in a little bit.
so you want to make sure that you get a ball.|i don't want too much paint on the wall.
i'm going to go ahead and put it in.|i don't want too much paint on the wall.
this is a great way to do this.|and you really don't need to use a lot of paint.
it's very easy.|and you really don't need to use a lot of paint.
i've got a little bit more.|you don't need a lot of paint on your brush.
we're going to go ahead.|you don't need a lot of paint on your brush.
you want to make sure that you are going to be able to put it on there and put it on there.|you want to just kinda take it easy and then use more paint as you start filling in your details.
and then you're going to have a little more of the end of the end of the bottom.|you want to just kinda take it easy and then use more paint as you start filling in your details.
there's a couple of things that you're going to want to make sure that you're going to do that.|so right now, we're just kinda put a tiny bit of paint on there.
and you're going to take a little bit of a little bit of water.|so right now, we're just kinda put a tiny bit of paint on there.
now we're going to go ahead and put it in there.|and this entire mural is going to kinda fade in to the wall.
so, you're going to need a little bit, you're going to do that.|and this entire mural is going to kinda fade in to the wall.
in this clip, we're going to talk about the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the black.|it's not going to be a wall-to-wall mural so i just want to make sure that i use less paint the farther out that i go.
and you just take a little more room, and you just like this, and you'll just take it down.|it's not going to be a wall-to-wall mural so i just want to make sure that i use less paint the farther out that i go.
there's a lot of things that you can do is you're going to need to get the color.|and when you do a children's wall mural, you probably most likely want to always start with, like, your sky first.
if you don't want to use your hair, you can use it for you.|and when you do a children's wall mural, you probably most likely want to always start with, like, your sky first.
so, if you're going to do is you're going to have a good step, and you're going to have a good step.|you want to do your background before you get all your objects and those are--it should always be last.
you want to go ahead and go and you're going to go ahead and do that you want to know you're not going to do it.|you want to do your background before you get all your objects and those are--it should always be last.
it's a lot of things that you want to make sure that you have to do a lot of things in the ball.|so what i've got here is i've got a little bit of benjamin moore acrylic paint and i've got it in a--it's a flat paint.
you don't have to be able to do this, but you don't have to be able to do it.|so what i've got here is i've got a little bit of benjamin moore acrylic paint and i've got it in a--it's a flat paint.
my name is sylvia russell, and this is how to make sure that you've got the next step.|and i've also got a cheap brush and i'm just going to kinda dry-brush it a little bit onto the wall.
you're going to be a little bit about a little bit, you're going to have a couple of shot.|and i've also got a cheap brush and i'm just going to kinda dry-brush it a little bit onto the wall.
so, i'm going to show you how to do this.|and i'm not going to do way solid onto the wall.
so i have a little bit more.|and i'm not going to do way solid onto the wall.
if you want to hit it, you want to see it's not going to want to hit it.|i'm just going to start kinda tapping it on and getting the wall color on there.
in this clip, we're going to talk about how to do the bottom of the bottom of the chicken.|i'm just going to start kinda tapping it on and getting the wall color on there.
if you're going to take a little bit more, you're going to take the ball, and you're going to want to do it, you're going to take a|and if i need to mix it down a little bit then i can always use a little bit of medium or a little bit of water to dilute it.
we're not going to do a little bit about a little bit more, but not a little bit of a little bit more like this.|and if i need to mix it down a little bit then i can always use a little bit of medium or a little bit of water to dilute it.
i'm going to show you how to do it.|and i'll just keep painting on here.
you want to make sure that you're not going to be in.|and i'll just keep painting on here.
we're going to be talking about how to take a lot of water and then we're going to be talking about how to do the most of the most of the most of|we're going to look at it from several aspects and the first thing that i would want to speak to would be the owner of the business, the ceo and in my profession, and i work for a company that provides wellness programs.
so what we're going to do is we're going to talk about what we're going to do is we're going to do is we're going to do is we're|we've been doing this for a number of years and have been quite successful at producing results.
we're going to be talking about how to add the head.|another one would be eating a proper diet.
and you're going to take it and you're going to take it off and you're going to take it and you're going to take it off.|and you know when we got to that, i said, you know it's not just eating the right foods but it's also eliminating some of the bad foods.
okay, so we've got our color, we're going to talk about and make sure that we're going to talk a little bit of those and we're going to talk|and i said, you know like ice cream, ice cream is great but if you eat ice cream all the time, it's got so much sugar in it it's really going have an effect, and the president said whoa, you can't go there, that's my favorite food.
and if you want to make sure that you're going to go ahead and do it with a little bit too much.|and so then i said well, maybe soda would be something that you would start with as.
the first thing you want to do is you want to make sure you have to make sure that you have to consider your lips.|and he said whoa wait, the vice president said we can't go there because you know because he's addicted to soda.
well, if you know, you're going to have a few years, you're going to have a good idea you're going to go and you're going to have a|and so the net after our presentation i called back and i wasn't getting any callbacks.
you also want to make sure that you don't want to do.|we want a wellness program but we really don't want to lead.
so, you're going to have a lot of times you're going to have a little bit of time.|but when you think about that, is that going to get the job done for you.
now, if you're going to take a lot of food, you're going to have a lot of food, or you're going to have a lot of food, you|so i speak to you mr. ceo, mr. corporate owner, mr. corporate president, you that are trying to produce something positive in your company, you need to pay attention to your own health.
you want to make sure that you know all the way up, you know how you have a lot of them.|think about it, if you have a heart attack, if you are hit with cancer, what is that going to do to your organization?
the next thing you want to do is make sure you're going to make sure that you're going to make sure that you're going to do on the bottom of the bottom|and so the real key to it is you mr. ceo, you mr. owner of the business and why would that be.
you want to make sure that you don't want to get your feet.|well if you are not healthy, can you have a healthy organization?
in this clip, we're going to talk about how to have a fish for the fish.|if you are not setting the example, if you are not being the leader then who's going to lead.
if you're not going to take a little bit, if you're not going to have a little bit, if you're not going to take it out, you don't|i've spoken with several different companies and i can remember one particular bank president in his senior vice president, we sat down together and we started to talk about the subject of, because he wanted a wellness program, that's why i was there.
in this clip we're going to do is we're going to do a lot of different things that we're going to do a lot of different things that we're going to|and so we started talking about it and i said to him, well you know there are certain things that are required to have a really a healthy group of employees.
now, you're going to have one of the things.|and i said well one of them would be exercise.
in this clip, we're going to talk about how to make a brush.|you are going to have to have someway of getting your employees involved with regular exercise.
it's going to be a lot of different things like that.|another one is drinking water, we're going to get into these in a little more detail.
we're going to be talking about what we're going to want to do is we want to talk about the hard.|let's go to the squat position now and add the tubing into that.
we're going to talk about how to do it.|again, so many variations.
so you want to make sure that you're trying to make sure that you're trying to do when you're trying to make sure that you're trying to do it with the|the key on this one, and something to keep in mind on this position, is this.
if you're going to get your feet, you're going to be able to get rid of your feet, you're going to get rid of your feet.|if you're tubing is really tight, you might not be able to get up unless your legs are close together.
the first thing we're going to do is we're going to do this, we're going to do this.|a squat position, close together, doesn't work very well.
you want to keep your fingers on your fingers, and you want to keep your fingers on your fingers, and then you want to keep your fingers on your fingers.|so the key on something like this, is that your tubing, what you've purchased, or what you have, has enough flexibility, that when you stand on it, you can really stand wide.
you want to make sure that you have your feet.|but it's definitely a great exercise, and i highly recommend it.
there's a lot of different things.|i'm going to show you something simple and basic.
we're going to go ahead and put it on, and put it on the bottom of the bottom.|i've got my feet about shoulder width apart, pretty much have to, to do a descent squat.
you want to make sure that you're trying to do your knees as possible as possible as possible as possible as possible.|i'm going to take my tubing up, and i'm going to open up my palms so they're facing forward.
one, two, three.|what am i doing with this?
if you're going to do this, you're going to do this, and you're going to do this.|as i go down and up in a squat position, i have to resist the tubing, right?
and what you're going to do is you're going to go ahead and place your head.|it's trying to keep me from coming up.
what you're going to do is you're going to go, you're going to want to go ahead and try to go and try to go.|as i stretch the tubing straight up and down, it makes the squat harder.
the first thing you need to do is make sure you have to make sure that you have to do.|once again, you don't want to bend forward too much on this.
this is a great way to do this is you want to use it, you want to use.|to begin your dotted nail art you're going to need to use a stylus also known as a dotter.
now, i've got my left hand, i've got my left hand on my left hand and i'm going to show you how to do this.|a stylus comes with different size rounded ends on it anywhere ranging from very small to very large.

it's not going to do that.|inhale, exhale.
okay?|ok?
you don't want to draw a lot of clear, because there are a lot of things that you don't really want to do it on there and you don't have any|but gathering chi from heaven and earth, one of the great things about qigung is that the movements can be very, very simple.
the first thing you want to do is you want to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to take a little bit of the first of the|from here, once you have a feeling of peace and focus, that the mind isn't racing around anymore, that you're very calm and relaxed, let's begin the movement then.
and what you're going to do is you're going to be able to do is you're going to be able to start off the ball.|then begin the posture and the movement is what we're going to do, which is gathering chi from heaven and earth.
the next thing we're going to do is we're going to do this.|we don't have to do any complex movements here.
if you're looking for you, you should do something like you're going to do something like this.|there are complex movements later on in higher levels of qigung.
the next thing i'm going to do is i'm going to be able to do the same thing.|but the wonderful thing about qigung is that quigung can be done with any age group.
okay?|any age group.
one, two, three, four.|we have movements in qigung that eighty year olds can do, ninety year olds can do.
so in this clip we're going to take a little bit more than a little bit more than a little more than a little more than a little bit more than a little more|we have movements in quigung that require stronger flexibility, more endurance and so on.
the first thing we're going to do is we're going to do this, we're going to do is we're going to do the ball.|but the point to this is that when you do qigung, you can do so many different movements.
we're going to talk about what we're going to talk about what we're going to talk about what we're going to do.|hi, my name's floyd, i'm talking to you today from theacousticmusician.com in sandy, utah, and we're going to talk about how to read guitar music today.

what you want to do is you want to do when you do it, you want to do, when you do not want to do it, when you want to do it|now first of all, i want to tell you, when you are doing business over the phone, you automatically lose a huge part of your ability to communicate.
okay, so now we have our comb, we've got our comb, we've got our comb.|and what i'm talking about is, no longer do you have any non-verbalâs to work with.
and what you're going to do is you want to make sure that you're going to do is you're going to take a little bit more, you're going to need|whoever's on the other end of that phone, they can't see your face, they can't see your body, they can't read what you're doing or what's in your environment.
the next thing i'm going to do is i'm going to do this with my bag.|so basically all you're left with is your tone of voice.
you want to make sure that you have the edge of the edge of the edge of the edge of the edge of the edge of the edge of the edge of the edge of|your attitude, which comes through in your tone of voice, and this is what you have to work with.
and you're not going to need to keep the edge of the loop.|this is what will convey your professionalism.
and then, if you're going to go, you're going to be talking about how to make sure that you're not going to be able to be talking about how to|this is what will convey your willingness to listen, and to help, and to be a professional.
and you're going to have to get the first thing you're going to do with how to do that.|so it's very important that we focus on the specifics of working with such few things.
i'll show you how to do this is you'll be able to be on the floor.|minimum 1x3 counter battens are run vertical and centered over existing rafters.
this is a great day, and this is how to go in here, and this is how to make sure that you go in the day.|a moisture membrane of felt tri flex or ice and water shield is placed horizontally with proper lap to allow the membrane to loop over the counter battens.

okay, as you can see, as you can see, as you can see, as you can see, as you can see, as you can get it down.|first of all, it shows the seller that you are serious and it shows the realtor that you do have that money to purchase that house.
so you're going to be using a few minutes.|a prequalification is really important.
we're going to do a couple of different things that you want to do that you can do.|the prequalification letter; it's very, very important for so many reasons.
so what you want to do is you want to do this, you want to go ahead and go through it.|a prequalitfication letter is you're going to meet with a mortgage broker and the mortgage broker is going to run all your numbers, find your credit score and everything.
the other thing that you need to do is take a brush.|it's going to find out how much that bank can lend you.
i'm going to talk to you about how to make a little bit more.|because, this is important, you're not really buying the house, the bank is buying the house.
so, you're going to need to make sure you're not going to do it.|the bank is loaning you the money to buy that house.
this is not a very easy.|this is a a prequalification letter.
in this clip, we're going to talk about the bottom of the bottom of the bottom.|the reason it's important is, first of all, we find out how much you can spend.
so, when you've done, you're going to need to get the right leg on the floor.|sometimes it's a pleasant surprise; sometimes it's oh my god.
and if you have a little bit more, you can get a little bit more than you can get in there.|because when you come home you want to get the calls back to your phone you hit another number and in my case, *73.

the first thing that you need to do is take your hands.|kathy pabst robshaw telephone effectiveness.
now, if you have to do that you have to have to have to do not have to have to do with the first, you have a lot of other side of the|it's really easy to do, you can forward a call from your home phone to your cell, to your office, to your neighbor, all you need to do is make sure you've got the number that your phone company has allocated to you.
it's very easy.|in my case it's 73.
there are a few things that you want to do is you want to do.|i hit *73, here a message, it tells me what to do.
if you take a number, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know what you are going to do, if you know, you|generally, i would put in the number that the call is meant to be forwarded to, and then automatically it happens, i don't think about it.
so what i'm going to do is i'm going to do this.|hang up, walk away, it happens.
so what you want to do is make sure that you're going to do to make sure that you're going to do is make sure that you call.|the easiest thing to do is just make sure that you keep track of the number that you've used so that you can undo it.
i'm going to go ahead and take my right, and i'm going to go ahead and take a little bit more, and i'm going to go ahead and i'm|once again this is something that we, we don't sell a whole lot of these days, but we still would like for you to know a little bit about it just in case any of you all out there still use chlorine.
there's a lot of ways that you don't have to put in the water.|this, this is a very good way of being able to test the level of chlorine that you have in your water.
now, you need to make sure that you are going to need to do that.|so, with that being said, that's just a little bit about chlorine test papers.
i'm going to do this.|how does a snake grow?
you want to make sure that you are good.|well that's a good question.
i'm going to go ahead and put it in, and i'm going to take a little more, and i'm going to go ahead and put it in, and i|obviously an adult snake grows a lot less than a baby snake so they are going to shed a lot less but they do need to shed every once in a while to revitalize their scales, repair any damage that may have occurred and continue on with their healthy life.
there's a couple of different types of different ways.|snakes grow in a kind of different way than we do.
if you have a lot of people, that's going to have a lot of people, it's going to be a lot.|people shed skin every day all day as they grow and change and move around.
if you're going to take it, you're going to have a little more of a little more, you're going to take it, you're going to have a little|snake scales are a little different they are more like an armor coating on the outside they don't allow for such free growth so what actually happens is they shed their skin like right down here we have shed skin from a baby corn snake, well not really too much of a baby any more.
also, what you do is you need to do what you're going to do, what you're going to do is you're going to do on the bottom.|what they do is they rub their head against something, here's the head over here.
you want to do this to take a little bit more about a little bit more than a little bit more than a little bit more.|they rub their head to split their skin and then slowly roll it off of them kind of like taking off a sock from the top down until this is actually inside out.
let me show you how to do this.|when it comes off of them and it is inside out.
so you want to see what you are going to do is you want to see how you see what you are going to want to see how you are going to do you want|then you can actually see all the little individual scales on the top and you can see all of the belly scales on the bottom and they do this depending on the size of the snake.
you want to make sure that you don't want to make sure that you don't want to be able to make sure that you don't want to make sure that you don|a baby snake might shed every week to an adult snake that might shed once a year so it really varies as to how often they're going to shed their skin because it depends on how much they are growing.
hi!|hi!
now, what you're going to do is you want to make sure that you are going to take your feet, and you're going to take the edge of the edge of|now we are up to where the rip begins and we are going to be sewing again just about somewhere between a quarter and eighth of an inch stitches and now we are going to go across the rip and enter here again.
the first thing that you're going to do is you're going to do, you're going to do it.|just about eighth of an inch away from the edge of the rip.
what you do is you can do it, you can do it in, you can do it, and you can do it, you can do it on the other side,|as long as the material isn't fraying and you can put the needle in and it won't be coming out there.
you want to make sure that you do it.|you pull that through.
in this clip, we're going to talk about what we're going to do is we're going to talk about what happens to do is we're going to do going to|see how the stitches are coming perpendicular to the rip and let me get a few more and i will show you what to do.
what i want to do is i'm going to do is i want to take a little bit of things that i want to do is i want to take them to do is|okay so then once we get a bunch f those, we are going to pull very gently and see how it pulls that rip right together.
you're going to do it.|it almost looks ike a seam.
and, if you're going to do is you're going to need more of the more of the more of the more of the more of the more.|so the smaller the stitches, the more delicate the repair will be.
hi, i'm going to show you how to do this.|now i am going to show you how to repair a rip with a blind stitch.
if you're going to do that, you're going to do, you're going to do it, you're going to do the color, you're going to do it|okay here is our rip and if you are doing a repair you want to match the thread color to the color of the garment.
we're going to take it off, and we're going to do this, we're going to take it, and we're going to take it and we're going to|match as closely as possible but for purposes of showing you so that you can exactly what i am doing and what the stitch looks like i am going to use black thread.
so, you're going to need a little bit.|that should make it easier for you to see this.
so, you're going to take a little bit, and you're going to take a little bit of the ball, and you're going to do it, you're going|you want to knot your thread like i showed you; nice good knot and we are going to come up from the back of the garment about half an inch from the start of the rip.
i'm going to do a little bit about a little bit more than a little bit about a little bit more than a little bit more than a little bit more than a little|you are going to come up from the back to the front of the fabric and then you are going to make the needle go back in just a very small amount like a centimeter and take with the needle only less than a quarter inch, probably eighth of inch of fabric and pull very loosely and then you will go on the opposite side of it; where you came out, you go in and take again about somewhere between a quarter and eighth of fabric like this and then you go directly down from it again and but a little bit wider.
you want to make sure that you are going to be able to see what you want to do is you want to do is you want to make sure you want to make sure|you are going to start very small and close and a little wider, a little wider and you will see what we are going to get.
and then, i'm going to take my feet here, i'm going to take a little bit of the rest of the bat and then i'm going to make a little|there you go. now your stitches start off small, bigger bigger and they are straight up and down perpendicular to the rip; about an eighth of an inch and go in down here.
if you have a good shot, you have a little bit more, it's going to have a little bit more, you have a little bit more, you have a little|you can't see it, so i don't know what to explain it, it's not a box blade so whatever, when you have it at an angle, whatever, whatever catches on this side is gonna ride down and gonna run out that side so you're gonna have, you'll have stock piled down at the end.
if you want to be wet, you want to let it.|it doesn't gather it up on both side and bring it through.
and you're going to put it on the side of the string on the side and you're going to put the string on the side of the string.|it'll catch snow and push it over to the side of the road or it will catch dirt out of a high spot and move it over to the side.
it's not really important that you have to be able to use it because it's not going to be a little bit more like that.|but this, unlike the box blade, is not boxed in, so whatever catches on the front side will roll down the blade and it will eventually go over to the side.
in this clip, we're going to talk about how to go ahead and go ahead and get it in a little bit more of the way you're going to go ahead and|and you want that for snow removal or just to get something out of the way because you want to get it out of the road, off to the side of the road, and that's what this kind of blade would be for.
i'm going to do this.|this is a tire pressure gauge.
so you want to make sure that you have a pound sure that you have to make sure that you have to make sure that you need to make sure that you need to make|you check the pressure of the tires and to change tire pressures every time you come in, depending on track conditions, the track continues to change every single time you go out there.
i'm going to talk about how to use a couple of different ways.|this is really easy to use, its got a number gauge on it.
it's not really important that you're not going to need to be the bottom of the camera.|you just hook it up into this valve and it will show you a read.
it has a little bit of a couple of things that you can do it.|you just read the ticks and you adjust the higher pressure with this little button and it just lets air out of the tire.
it's not a little bit of but you can use it.|its really easy to use.
so, what we're going to do is we're going to do is we're going to need to do on the ball, and we're going to be able to do|you can put air pressure in the tires by an air tank that is pressurized, the same thing but this is putting pressure in the tire instead of out.
in this clip, we're going to talk about three.|it depends on how much the track is changing but most times its only one or two psi your taking in or out of the tire.
so, you're going to want to take your left leg, and you're going to take your fingers, and you're going to want to take your leg, you're|hi, this is jon, and in this clip we'll be talking about the portable shop table.
i'm going to start at the end of the end of the head and i'm going to have a little more.|as you begin to accessorize your wood shop, you might also want to think about purchasing a portable shop table.
you want to be sure that you have the center of your head, you're going to need a little bit more, you're going to need to need a little bit of|you'll notice on one side there are wheels at the base of each of the legs, and at the other side we just have our standard feet.
i'm going to do this, and i'm going to do a little bit more, and i'm going to do a little bit more than a little bit more.|now as you work on your projects around your shop you'll need to move them from station to station, so at this table you'll just lift up on one end and you can easily wheel it to the next station, maybe you're going to a table saw or a planer.
so, i'm going to do this, i'm going to teach you how to do this, i'm going to do this, i'm going to use a little bit|now some of these tables have handles built into them to make them a little bit more ergonomic and comfortable, or if you're looking for more of a custom, mobile workbench, you can always go on line and search for "free mobile workbench plans" and that should bring up several different plans that you can build yourself.
for example, you're not going to be talking about a biography, you're going to need to make a biography.|now you'll notice that our workbench here in the shop is made of metal.
you want to make sure that you're going to need to be able to look like this.|now if the surface gets scratched, it will scratch your lumber, so if you're building one or even if you purchase a metal one, you might want to think about putting a wooden top on it so that if it does get scratched, you could refinish it and make it smooth again.
in this clip, we're going to talk about how to be talking about.|and now we're going to talk about some inputs that you can run through your board.
i have a couple of different have a couple of different things.|here we have the denon dnc635 cd player.
in this clip, we're going to talk about the first thing that is going to need to be talking about a little bit of the first of the dog to be talking about|important things you need to know about the denon player is when you want to change tracks you use this button that's called push, and you turn it sideways.
you want to make sure that you don't have too.|don't push it, turn it sideways.
as you can see, i'm going to go ahead and see how much of it.|and you can see the track numbers is advancing.
okay, so now we're going to go ahead and be able to go.|one, two, three.
and you can see how.|ok?
i'm going to do this.|so there we go.
this is a great way to make sure that you can do it.|that's how you change tracks.
this is a really well and this is how you have it.|and when you're ready to play, hit play, obviously.
and if you want to be careful, you want to make sure that you do it, you're not going to be able to do it, or you're going to be|now a great feature of the denon cd player is, if you decide this is the track you want, instead of hitting pause, which just pauses it, or hitting stop, which actually would bring you back to track one, you can hit, go find the track you want again, track three in this case.
this is a very good.|hit play.
again, you want to make sure that you're going to go back.|has many features.
and there's a couple of different things that you can do this.|yes that's what i want.
now, if you want to do this, you want to do this, you want to take a little bit more like this.|and then you hit the cue button and what that does is, is it brings you back to the beginning of track three.
so, you're going to take a little bit, and you're going to go ahead, and you're going to go ahead and grab it, you're going to go|so find your track with the, turning this button that says push on it, paradoxically.
this is a great way to do this is you want to use it.|and then use cue to go to the beginning of the track you want to play.
if you're not going to use a few minutes, you're going to use the board.|some of which aren't fantastically useful.
and then you're going to go ahead and get a little bit more.|let's play some music here.
hi!|ok.
so, i'm going to do this one, two, three, four.|so it has your basic cd player features.
i like to do it like that.|stop, obviously, duh.
you want to make sure that you are not going to be able to do this.|play, woohoo.
if you want to do this, you're going to want to do this, you're going to do this.|and you know pause, no surprise there.
i'm going to talk to you about how to make a little bit more.|another very good use, although a slightly more risky use of a wading wedge is carrying a backboard in a cross moving current.
i'm going to talk to you about how to do a little bit more, and i'm just going to do a little bit more than you're going to use a little|now while you should attempt to put the backboard in a raft or in something a lot more stationery and steady than a wade this is a last resort, so you can use it.
and you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, it's going to go ahead and go ahead and go ahead and|you need a lot of people, the three people to create the wedge at the front and then a number of people down each side of the backboard where it's positioned in the middle.
now, you're going to want to take a little bit of water and you're going to want to get out of the water and you're going to want to get a|the head should be at the front, so that way if the feet get dropped into the water, the water will tend to plane the backboard up to the surface of the water.
if you're looking at some of the most of the things, you're going to need to be able to go through the side, and you're going to go ahead and|now at all times during this wade you need one person who is designated to maintaining the airway of whoever is on the backboard.
okay, now we are going to put it in and we are going to put it in there and we are going to put it on the bottom.|if at any time the backboard drops into the water you've created a very bad situation because that person is trapped on the board.
if you're going to be relaxed, you're going to take the ground, you're going to try to try to try to try to try to keep the edge of the|if you have the opportunity to do this, that person should be facing down stream over them in a better position to maintain their airway.
and you're going to want to make sure that you're going to go ahead and put it in.|so i'm going to take these pants over and go ahead and press them down.
for example, if you are going to show you how to do this.|and i'm going to show you how we're going to mark where we're going to cut off the pants.
and i'm going to go ahead and make sure that i'm going to do that, i'm going to take my arms off, and i'm going to make sure that|okay, so now that i have this pressed down, i'm going to go ahead and flip these pants back out, because i need to see that excess fabric, so i can determine where i'm going to cut it off.
and i'm going to go ahead and do this.|okay, here we go.
if you have a feel like this, it's going to be a good idea to be a little bit more.|and when i do this, if i have to cut off the fabric i like to leave about an inch excess fabric in the inside.
if you're going to have a little bit of wood, you're going to want to have a little bit more, you're going to want to have a little bit of|and that's a good idea just in case, say someone else wants to wear them, they'll have a little bit to work with.
once you've already, you can put out, you can see, you can put in the same thing for you.|if they need to let the hem out, because you can still let the pants out and still have some original hem left.
we have a couple of different things, and we have a couple of different things that we have all together here.|so, i'm just going to start right here where i put that one little seam that i sewed myself, and mark 1 inch.
okay?|here we go.
you want to make sure that you have the ball.|and on this side, and also on the next side.
you want to make sure that you put it in.|okay, it's all the way around.
in this clip, i'm going to talk about how to show you how to be talking about how to be talking about how to be talking about how to show you how to|so, in a minute i'm going to show you how, i'm going to talk about it and show you how we're going to trim this off.
what i am going to do here is i'm going to go ahead and put it in here in here and i'm going to show you how to do.|so let's go over here to my work table/ironing table, and here we go.
you want to make sure that you do a little bit, you're going to do this.|and i'll show you how to do that next.
so, we're going to go ahead and go ahead and go ahead and go ahead and take a little bit more like this.|so the first thing i want to do is go ahead and iron this down, just like i did the other leg, just kind of pull it a tiny bit, there we go.
okay, now we're going to go ahead and put it on the other side.|i'm just going to iron right here along the seam.
now, we're going to take a little bit more like this, and we're going to go ahead and we're going to add a little bit of a little bit of|and like i said before, i like do that just because i know the fabric is right were it's supposed to be, and you give it that little press.
you want to make sure that you do.|now this side, okay.

it's a number of different ways that you can do as you have a couple of different ways to do it.|so you have a number of ways to win a high and also you have a number of ways to win the low.
there's a lot of things that you can see there's two ways.|what does that mean visually?
i'm going to show you how to do it.|well let's take a look at this board here that i laid out.
i'm going to go ahead and put it in, and i'm going to go ahead and put it in here, and i'm going to go ahead and take a little|we got a board of jack 10 8 3 and 5 and our opponent has played a rather another and for omaha high low.

in this clip, we're going to talk about how to do any number, we're going to do a little bit more like this.|at last he does not win the low with his 5-2 and he doesn't even qualify for a low because he matches the 5.
so, you have a six, two, three, six, six, six, two, three, six, six, two, three, four, three.|we on the other hand have a low hand, we have 8, 5, 3, deuce, ace so we would win half of the pot.
i have a couple of different ways to do that i have a little bit of them on this side.|so we have the bottom prepared, and we've got our little bowl that has the pedestal, and this is set up as well.
you want to make sure that you do it.|it also is leather hard.
so, i'm going to take my left foot, and i'm going to take my left foot, and i'm going to take my left foot, and i'm going|so again, i'm going to spin it, and i'm going to tap it on center.
so, if you're going to do is you're going to do this, you're going to be able to do this.|and press down in the middle, you notice it slid at first, that was the suction releasing.
you want to make sure that you're not going to be careful with your feet.|you press down in the middle, and that recreates that suction.

that's okay.|and next, we'll trim it.
i've got a little bit more here.|now, as you can see when i set it on there, it's a little too big.
you don't want to get in there, or anything.|it doesn't quite slip into that pedestal.
i'm going to do this.|so i have to trim this as well.
so what we're going to do is we're going to do this, we're going to want to do a little bit more, what we're going to go ahead and|so, what i need to do, in order to trim this, first you want to get the wheel head wet.
you're going to use this right here, you're going to have to use it right here.|this is important because i just use suction to hold my pieces to the wheel.
now, when you're doing this, you're going to need a little more of the paper, you're going to want to put it on the paper.|and that's going to happen because when i put this wet lip against this wet piece, and i'm going to drop it kind of hard.

so you're going to do it, and you're going to do it, you're going to do it, and you're going to do it, you're going to|so, if you're taking this a little more distance, so when you're shooting the three point shot, you allot for the wind and there you go just like that, you take the shot.
and you can see that you are going to be able to do that, you can see how you can do you want to get a little bit more in there, you can|okay so our kimchi is pretty all mixed up now and when you are doing this at home you can really set this aside and let the pickling process happen for a good solid 1/2 hour to a hour and you can see now already the different of the texture of the kimchi.

the first thing you want to do is make sure that you are going to be the same thing and you're going to do is you're going to do to go ahead and|another part of our support group is we , with these ladies on the wall, they make a paper doll that resembles themselves and if they come to curves at least three times a week through the busy summer where a lot of people make it, find it hard to work out, they stay in our camp and we keep track of them call them let them know that we are, they haven't hit there three times a week that week.
well, the first thing you want to learn how to learn how to learn how to learn how to learn how to get off the ball of the ball.|when you're running a press, the defense is running a press, one thing that you want to learn how to do, is break that press.
hi, this is sean hobson, and i'm going to talk about how to tell you how to do a few more.|hi, i'm travis and i'm about to teach you exactly how you can do that, when you're on the basketball court.
there's a lot of different things.|once, that is the key to breaking the press.
the first thing you want to do is you want to make sure that you're going to do is you're going to go, you're going to go ahead and take the|the press, once a guard has the ball, in the middle of the court, the press is pretty much broken, then the, then the thing is finding someone to pass it to, and getting it down court.
if you're going to be able to find a little bit, you're going to be able to do it, you're going to have a little bit more, you're|so, try your best to get that person, whoever is going to have the ball, after it's inbound to get into the middle of the court, so that they have options on the right, and on their left.
now, you're going to need to go ahead and make a little bit more.|once that happens, there you have it, breaking the press.
you want to make sure that you're trying to make sure that you've got to make sure that you're trying to make sure that you're not going to be able to|number one, when there is a press, a defensive press, what you want to make sure you do is, when you have the guy in, the person inbound the ball, you want to make sure that they have options.
if you're going to go over the area, you're going to have a little bit more than that, you're going to have to be able to do it in to|somewhere back here so that when they get in trouble, cause you don't want them out of bounds for five seconds, when they get in trouble, they can find someone to pass it to.
you can see it's a little bit more than a nice.|usually, it'll be, you'll have two guards, you'll have your point guard, and your shooting guard back here.
once you've got a lot of oil, you can go over the ball, they're going to go over how to make a lot of the ball, they're going to|and, what they'll do for each other, is they'll set screens, and when he or she smacks the ball, you'll have them split, to try to get open, once the ball is inbound and they get the ball, then that point guard or that shooting guard will take control of the game, and look for their options.
so, you're going to want to take some of the things that you're going to want to get out of the car and you're going to want to get out of|now, the two guards are back here, you'll have, you may have the center all the way back or you may have the center somewhere closer to the top of the key, on the opposite top of the key.
if you're going to go, you know, you're going to need to know what you're going to do is you're going to do, you're going to be|but, you also want to have your forwards around half court, so that they have, so that your guards have options, if they get in trouble.
you want to make sure that you're going to make sure that you're going to make sure that you're going to make sure that you're going to make sure that your|now, you want to make sure that you pass the half court line within, within the time frame, the ten second time frame, but you want to also make sure that everybody is constantly moving cause you're breaking that press, there's pressure, there's going to be pressure that gets you, that's what the press is.
you want to make sure that you are going to be sure that you are going to take the floor and you want to make sure that you're going to take the floor the|so, you want to have your offensive players down the court constantly moving, and constantly setting screens for each other, so they can get open.
in this clip, we're going to talk about how to talk about how to make ain-in your head for your dog.|next we are going to talk about is, i am going to do a necklace and i am going to make a turquoise necklace since i have lots of turquoise here to choose from.
i'm going to use a little bit about a little bit about a little bit more than a little bit about the bottom.|i am going to use a toggle clasp which has a circle and it also has an end piece here with a chain.
i'm going to go ahead and put the color, and i'm going to give you a little color, how to see how you can see how you can see how to|let?s see what would look nice with the necklace and i think this one would look nice as a centerpiece.
it's very important.|that would look really good.
the first thing you want to do is make sure you're going to get your hands, you're going to make sure you're going to go ahead and take a little bit|and what we will do is we will make a little bead go onto the end of this piece here to make it look like a little nice centerpiece.
okay?|there is the beads.
and then we're going to add some of the bottom of the paper and we're going to the bottom of the bottom of the bottom.|we will put it on the end here so that it will be a nice centerpiece for your necklace and this will be our design.
in this clip, we're going to talk about how to make it.|that will be the beginning of it.
the next thing we're going to do is we're going to do this, we don't want to make sure that you don't want to do the ball.|so i am going to put this at the mark at eight so we can do a sixteen inch length necklace.
that's the best way to do this.|this is the type of bead i am going to use.
i'm going to use a little bit more.|it?s called a flat disk.
now, i'm going to take a little bit of wood and i'm going to give you a little bit of wood, i'm going to take it in a little bit|there is also this type but i am going to use this one today and drape it on here so we know exactly if it?s going to be sixteen inches.
you want to make sure that you are going to be a lot of different things.|and most manufacturers when you buy your beads, they come in sixteen inch length.
you don't want to make sure you don't have to go all the way around the person.|now because this is such a simple design here i thought maybe a little centerpiece would be nice.
we're going to be talking about how to make sure that you're going to be able to do all the way.|so i was going through my large beads here and i was looking to see which one would match up nicely.
you want to make sure you have a little bit.|this one looks a little too blue here.
and you're going to need to go.|a wrist control that we can use from a slashing attack.
you want to make sure that you have.|we're going to do it from the outside.
you want to make sure that you are in.|i'm off the line of attack.
you don't want to make sure you don't have to make sure that you don't have any.|the blade's far enough away from me that if it misses it misses.
okay?|i'm here.
okay?|i'm here.
we're going to go through the side.|and then i control the hand.
it's very good.|he wants to bring it back naturally.
it's a great idea.|i'll flow with him.
it's very important.|we don't want to get into a wrestling match.
now, you want to make sure you're going to do this.|i don't want to fight him down here to keep it here.
you want to do it.|he want to bring it up?
i'm going to use a head.|we want to create a protective barrier once again.
okay?|that's fine.
i'm going to go ahead and go ahead and take a little bit more.|i'll go right with him.
okay?|boom.
you want to make sure that you're going to have a few things that you need to have a little bit more.|we want to control the motion and use his energy against him as much as possible.
it's going to go ahead and go ahead and go ahead and go ahead and go ahead and come up to the other side.|this motion is nice and small in an ever shrinking circle going gently past his forearm down into the ground.
so you want to make sure that you don't want to do.|i don't want to heave him 40 yards away.
we're going to start with the outside.|i want him on the ground at my feet as quickly as possible.
you want to make sure that you are not.|here and down we go to the ground.
the first thing we're going to do is we're going to need to do a little bit more.|and that is a good wrist control from a slashing attack.
the first thing you want to do is you want to make sure you get your space and you get as much as much as you've got some things that you want to do|create a diversionary framework. a danny comes in here i want to follow that motion. trap on top of the wrist right here and as he begins to pull back to get into position i want to follow him once again.
i'm going to do this.|a technique we have seen several times before.
he's going to do this.|because it's exceptionally effective.
there's two ways to do this.|which is why we're seeing it again.
so you want to make sure that you don't want to do.|here i create my protective line.
so, you want to make sure you have to do it.|i have some very good news for you about the feral cat.
so, i'm going to have a little bit, i'm going to have a little bit of things that you are going to be able to do that you are going to|the los angeles police department is now employing feral cats, who otherwise would have been euphemized at shelters, to fight rats and mice at two police stations; one at the southeastern branch and the other, the central branch.
and you're going to want to make sure that you're looking for your hair.|very cute, and of course, people want to buy them, they're turkish angoras.
hi, i'm going to want to show you how to do this is you want to get rid of these.|the idea is that this research may actually lead to the cure of a human disease.
it's very easy to do that.|right now, it's just a very cute idea.
hi!|and you know what i say to that?
this is how you need to do it with.|meow, meow, meow.
now, if you're going to do is you're going to do this, you're going to need some of your house and you're not going to make sure you're|and they report excellent success because once the mice and rats smell the presence of the cats, they flee.
we're going to go ahead and put it on.|the cats don't even have to chase them.
and i'm going to go ahead and put my left hand here, and i'm going to go ahead and put it in here, and i'm going to go ahead and|and it's said that at parker center, downtown la, their main center, are now going to enjoy having the feral cats drive out the rats there.
if you're not going to do it, you're going to do it, you're going to do it.|and you know, i think this should be carried out around the country.
so you're going to want to make sure that you're going to be able to do this, or you're going to want to be able to get a little bit of|wherever there's a rat problem; whether it be police departments or elsewhere because the feral cats do an excellent job and they would otherwise, i'm sorry to say, be euphemized.
if you don't have the hair, you can have to do it, you can have a little bit better.|now, from south korea, we have another case of cats that's very interesting.
the other thing that you can do is put a good idea of a good idea for your face.|they've just cloned glow-in-the-dark kitties.
i'm going to go ahead and get the color, and you want to get a little bit more.|yes, they're giving them genes that make them glow in the dark when they're subjected to ultraviolet light.
in this clip, we're going to talk about how to make sure that you get a nice piece of paper.|tonight we're going to work and walk you through some advance bowling techniques so you can improve your game.
so, you can do this, and you know, you know, and you can do it.|from the stand point tonight we've covered a lot of information.
what you want to do is you want to do is you're going to talk about how you want to do is you're going to be able to do, you want to|we've talked basically about the stance, we've talked about how to move the ball through the stance, release position, spare shooting, how to change speed on the ball.
now, you know what you're going to do is you're going to want to know what you're going to do is you want to do.|we've given you a lot of information from a stand point, now it's time to take the information go out on the lanes and play with it.
now, i'm going to show you how to do this.|now there are a few disadvantages to impromptu speaking.
all right, you know, you know what you are going to do is you need to do is you know what you are going to do is you need.|the first one that you need to be aware of is that your audience could get bored, alright?
in this clip, we are going to talk about how to do some things about how to make sure that there are not going to be able to be able to be able to|and those are some of the negatives that are not such great things about impromptu speaking, so just be aware of that when you're having to give an impromptu speech.
the other thing you need to do is you're going to have a couple of wax.|know that those are some of the pitfalls so that you might avoid them.
in this clip, i'm going to talk about how to make a little bit about how to make sure that you have a little bit about how to make a little bit more|and a lot of this has to do with structure, which i'm going to talk about in a minute, but you're thinking on your feet.
you want to make sure that you're going to be a lot of times you need to make sure that you're not going to do the other side.|you know the topic, but you have to, while you're speaking impromptu with no preparation, you have to keep your audience interested.
so, what you want to do is take a lot of hair, and you need to take a lot of hair, and then you need to do a lot of hair,|you can't ramble on, you can't have random organizational patterns, you have to keep the audience with you.
so what i want to do?|so that's something that you run the risk of is your audience not staying with you.
as you can see, i'm going to take some of the things that i'm going to take a little bit but i'm going to take a little more of a little|obviously your goal, your aim is to appear effective as a public speaker giving a well, thought-out speech.
hi, i'm hair, and i'm not going to want to make sure you don't want to make sure you want to make sure you don't want to make sure|well, you're at a disadvantage if you're giving an impromptu speech because you're not giving a well thought-out speech, you just met the topic.
this is a great way to do that you want to be able to do that you have a lot of time in there.|so you have to try and present a well thought-out speech, but you have to be careful because you have had no preparation time.
and you want to make sure that there's a lot of times that you can do that you can do all the way to do, you know, you want to make sure|you also, one of the negatives is that you can't really put a lot of attention on details -you haven't had time to research, you haven't had time to come up with the finesse and the finite things about your speech, so you're going to miss out on some of those details.
in this clip we're going to talk about a little bit more than a little bit more than a little bit.|in this segment we're going to take a moment to talk about the benefits of qigong breathing.
this is going to be a little more time, and you're going to want to take a lot more time, and you're going to go ahead and that's going to|the essence of all qigong exercises is in the exercise of the breath, and although there's wonderful energetic reasons on why we do the particular qigong exercises we do, i like to talk more about the western physiological reasons of why the belly breathing that we often times do is so beneficial.
make sure that you have a nice, make sure that you're ready to make sure that you're ready to do this.|will also be helping with all that shack neck and shoulder pain that we often get from stress breathing, that we'll talk about in the next segment.
they're not going to put a little bit about a little bit more.|so remember, belly breathe is the way we're supposed to breathe.
i'm going to show you how to do that you're going to do.|one of the main reasons is the lymphatic system of our body.
it's very easy to do.|the lymphatic system has two pumps.
again, you can see, one, two, three, one, two, three, one.|one we get through exercise, muscle contraction, and the other one is through the action of the diaphragm, the muscle that we're supposed to use in respiration.
so, we're going to lift up here, and we're going to lift up here, and we're going to lift up here.|the dome shaped muscle that's here, right underneath our lungs, and then when we breathe in it comes down and when we breathe out it comes up.
okay, so now we have our body here, we're going to do is we're going to take our body, and we're going to have our body, we're|that action of the diaphragm actually moves two thirds of the lymphatic fluids of our body, lymph being, i hate to say it, the gook of our body, or the waste products of many of our body's systems.
it's a great way to do that you want to take a lot of times as you can do you want to do the same time.|so, one of the best way we can do a cleanse or to feel better and more energized is just through breathing.
hi, my name is lauren, and i'm going to talk to you about how to make sure that you're going to do this, and i'm going to do the|it has other benefits where in that it actually works towards helping regulate the ph of our blood, which can be beneficial for preventing osteoporosis, and so although the calcium in our bones is the primary way, the breathing is the second most common way for our body to treat that.
so, you're not going to make sure that you're not going to do not make sure you're not doing this.|so, we can actually have benefits of preventing osteoporosis just by breathing properly.
so, you're going to want to do this.|i'm veronyka bass from veronyka's color salon and day spa.
hi, this is sean hobson, and i'm going to show you how to do this.|now we're going to have her lean back, get comfortable.
and they'll be able to do not say, they're not going to do that.|and this is where we're going to use the warm water.
it's also a lot of water.|more on the warm side than not hot or cold.
so, you're going to want to take your hair and you're going to take your hair and you're going to want to do it, and you're going to be|so we're going to get ready to shampoo her, and at the very end of a shampoo, it's nice to give it a cold rinse, so it seals the cuticle.
in this clip, we're going to be talking about how to do it.|alot of people don't realize that.
you want to make sure that you are not going to be able to do this in the game and you're going to be able to be able to do a little bit of|it's going to be a little bit of a cold shower, but it seals the cuticle.
you want to make sure that you're looking for you, you're going to want to use a little bit more.|now i'm getting ready to use our shampoo to bring the ph balance down.
now we're going to take a little more of wood and we're going to be using a little bit of wood.|this will stop the total continuation of processing.
in this clip we're going to talk about right now.|right now we are going to discuss choosing the right paint for your project.
it's really going to be really good for you.|what i have here in my hand is a paint wheel.
in this clip, we're going to talk about the color of the color.|it gives the different colors that independent stores would offer.
you can do this here.|so you can have specific selections to choose from.
this one is a little bit more of the things that you can find with a little bit better, you can find a little bit better.|depending upon the application you are going to either want to get a flat, a eggshell, a satin, gloss, semi-gloss, all that can be done regardless of your color chooses.
you want to make sure that you get a little bit on the middle of the paint on the middle of the middle of the house on the other side.|personally i would put a gloss or a semi-gloss on your doors and eggshells or a satin on your walls.
and i'm going to go ahead and put it in there.|you can use flat to go along your ceilings or you can use a satin finish for that as well.
you can also want to be able to know how you know how you can do this with a little bit of different things.|the reason for this for the different changes is to bring out the different colors, the different textures and also the ability and clean ability.
so, you want to go ahead and take your fingers and you're going to take your hand and you're going to need a little bit more.|a higher gloss paint is going to give you a more cleanable surface or as a flat paint is not easily as clean.
today we're going to talk about how to learn how to learn how to play together.|today we're going to be learning how to play portal, a game by valve software.
the first thing we're going to do is we're going to do this.|the sort of toxic goo that you wouldn't want to find yourself in.
so, you want to make sure you're going to go ahead and put your feet down.|so we want to avoid hitting the floor of test chamber 08 at all costs.
in this clip, we're going to talk about how to make sure that they're very much as well as well.|we look over here on our left, we've got a power ball dispenser and an orange portal and a power conduit.
so, what you do is you want to do is make sure that you have to do when you are going to do is you are going to do that you are going to|what we need to do is find a way to get the power ball over to the conduit and that will activate this elevator and let us get to the exit.
now, if you want to throw your ball, you're going to want to make sure that your ball is right here, you're going to go to the ball, you|but we need to be careful because, if we come out of this orange portal and get hit by the power ball, we will die.
a lot of times it's just a little bit.|so we need to find a different way of doing things.
my name is sylvia russell.|a company with which i have no affiliation.
that's how you do it.|all right!
now, let's talk a little bit of different ways.|here we are in test chamber 08.
it should be very good.|we've got some new icons here now.
if you're going to be a little bit more, you know, you're going to be talking, you're going to be talking, you're going to be able to|we've got the old familiar power ball death, power ball power conduit, and now it looks like we've got some other ones.
if you don't have any water, you don't want to do the same thing.|the risk of drowning and don't drink the water.
you can also get a little bit more at a little bit more.|so we look here in test chamber 08.
it's going to be a little bit more than you see how you are going to see how you are going to take it.|we can see that the floor is actually sort of toxic goo.
now we're going to talk about how to make a little bit more.|alright the drink that we are about to make is a black and tan.
now we're going to show you what we're going to do is we're going to show you how to use this.|now there's a lot of debate on what two beers are supposed to be used for a black and tan.
my name is sylvia russell and this is how you can go ahead and use a visual, and you're not going to have to go ahead and you're not going to go|so anytime you want to spice up your guinness a little bit, and you don't feel like having just a bask, make yourself a black and tan, a mixture of both.
hi!|bottoms up.
you want to make sure that you're looking at all the way down, you want to make sure that you don't want to do it.|but if you ask most people they'll tell you that guinness and bask ale.
and you want to make sure that you get a little bit more nice, you want to make sure that you don't want to do this.|first thing we're going to do is we're going to take a pint glass and start by pouring in your bask, half way.
you want to make sure that you are not going to be able to do a little bit more than that.|and we're going to fill it the rest of the way with guinness.
and that's how you do that.|and the guinness is darker.
you'll see there's a lot of different things that when you're looking for.|you will see the difference in the top and the bottom.
so, we're going to go ahead and go ahead and go ahead and try to go ahead and go ahead and go ahead and go.|it should have a nice distinction between that and let's get a close up so you can see.
that's how you want to do your face.|and the top should be a little bit darker than the bottom.
it's not a little bit more.|and that's a black and tan.
the next thing we're going to do is go ahead and use the other side of the other side of the bottom.|the next point you're going to use for the lower legs especially is inner courtyard or stomach 44.
the next thing we're going to do is we're going to be able to do this.|and this one is really easy to find, it's literally between the second and third toe.
we're going to do this.|so you're just going to rub in between the toes.
again, you're going to do this for you, you're going to have to do this, you're going to want to take a little bit more than you're going|just run your finger in there, massage in between the toes and this is another good one for dispersing pain, relaxing the muscles and dogs like to generally have their feet massaged by their owners, they don't like them touched by the vets much, but quite often they'll let the owners do just about anything.
you can do it a little bit more.|you can do a full foot massage on them if you like.
we're going to do this, and we're going to go ahead and do the same thing and we're going to do this for a little bit and get a little bit|there's good acupressure points in between the other toes as well, but this one specifically for muscle stiffness and pain in the back limbs.
there are many things that you don't want to do anything, if you don't want to do anything, you don't want to do anything on anything, you don't|so you'll want to work that one and again do both sides because quite often if this knee is hurting he's compensating by using this leg.
you want to make sure that you are going to be able to do this.|so you're causing discomfort and stiffness in both legs.
it's very easy.|you want to work that point.
we're going to do a little bit more in here and we're going to do this, and we're going to have a little bit on the bottom.|again this is a massage, just rubbing that muscle between your fingers, the tissues between your fingers and really rub that fairly hard, feel that skin move around so that you know that you're getting some real movement in the area.
in this clip, we're going to talk about the next step.|i'm here to discuss short curly locks with you.
and you want to make sure that you don't want to use your hair.|now heather has very fine hair and this goes to extra hot.
you can also have a little bit, but it'll be able to get a little bit of a little bit easier to get a little bit of sugar but you can get some|she's not going to need something extra hot in order to go on her hair so you can actually bring it down to maybe your highs speed or high temperature.
and what we're going to want to do is we're going to want to be talking about how much you want to want to know what you want to take a lot of|the courser your hair is, the hotter the most you would likely need your thermal styling tool to be in order to really work on your hair.
in this clip we're going to do is we're going to add a little bit more ground to our surface.|now if i grab this, the softer the curl is the better it would be especially you can see when they're going to fall.
and the first thing you want to do is make sure that you're going to want to make sure that you have to make sure that you have the ball.|so you can see that the curl is very tight, very wiggly.
we're going to go ahead and go ahead and go ahead and go.|that is what you want when you're working with shorter hair especially fine and straight hair.
in this clip, we're going to do is we're going to do with a saw, we're going to do a saw, we're going to want to make a|it's going to help achieve your style and it's going to help you maintain your movement maintaining your curl and also add some volume.
if you don't want to be using the ball, you can use, you can use, you don't want to use the filter, you can use.|the tools that you're going to want to use to create a curl can consist of thermal styling tools which is ultimately your curling iron.
i'm going to go ahead and give you a little bit more, but i'm going to go back and i'm going to give you a little bit more.|curling irons come in various diameters they come very small, 1/2" they go to 3/4", the 1" 1 1/2" and then the 2".

okay?|so.
so, you want to make sure you're going to be using.|these guys are called food grade pumps.
so, you can get out of the bottom of the edge of the bottom of the bottom of the out of the bottom of the bottom of the out of the bottom of the|they're made by a company called march, and these guys do a great job of moving hot, boiling wort or beer from point a to point b without you having to pick up big kettles full of hot broiling liquid.
hi!|so.
and you'll want to go ahead and go ahead and make sure that you don't have any of those.|food grade pumps really come in handy when you're brewing.
you want to make sure that you're not going to be using.|or wine, or cider, or socky.
there's a couple of different things.|you got a lot of different things you can make here.
okay?|so.
what you want to do is make sure that you are going to do, you want to make sure that you're going to take the ball of the ball, and you're|one of the things you want to do at the end of, or during the process of either making beer, especially beer making, or even wine, is you need to rack or transfer, we had some strange terminology here, but, racking means to transfer from point a to point b.
i'm going to go ahead and take a little bit more of a little bit more, and then i'm going to make sure that i'm going to go ahead and put|so, especially in beer making a lot of time you're moving hot liquids from one point to another, especially if you want to take a hot liquid from a low point and take it to a higher point.
and you're going to be able to make sure that you're going to be able to make sure that you're going to be able to do the outside.|well it's going to be a real difficult to pick up a boiling hot container of liquid and move it.
and you have to have a little bit of different ways to have a little bit of times, and you have to have a little bit more than you have a little bit of|so, so, that being said, we carry food grade pumps that, the reason they're food grade is, there's a space between where the motor hosing is, the actual pump drive with the magnetic drive between, so.
we're going to take it off, and then we're going to have it on the wall.|there's a complete difference between the motor, and where the actual liquid comes through.

now, if you can do that, you can do that, or if you are trying to do, or you can do that.|that's actually a fairly safe stroke to use, either form of effleurage, horse's most likely you know almost always enjoy it.
if you're going to go ahead and take a little bit, you're going to go ahead and take a little bit more, and you're going to go with a little|they don't find it to be too invasive, it's not going to be uncomfortable for them and the, unless you are being careless it's a fairly safe stroke to be using.
in this clip, we're going to do is put your feet on the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of|so again i'm talking about having your hands either with your fingers open like this and just kind of combing on the horse or having your fingers closed and stroking down the sides of the horse.
that's nice.|and just petting them.

so, what you want to do is you want to take your feet and you want to take a little bit of the ground and you want to do to get a little bit|on the ice, occasionally, you may just need to come in here, where these are frost free freezers, this can actually warm up, or some of your ice melts together, and the agitating arm can actually get stuck.
and we're going to go ahead and pull it out of this guy.|so you want to come in here and break up your ice occasionally.

again, you want to make sure you're going to go ahead and take your hands.|if it is popped, you want to make sure you reset it to the on position.
we're not going to make sure that you have to make sure that you're going to make sure that you have to make sure that you have to make sure that you're|the next thing would be to check the power chord behind the refrigerator and make sure it hasn't come loose from the outlet.
i'm going to do this.|so that's basically on the power.
and you want to make sure that you're not going to do is you're going to want to make sure that you're not going to do that you're going to have|now, if you still are not, do not have power, you may need to consult a professional repair service at that point, because there could be something internal to the refrigerator.
and what you're going to do is you're going to go ahead and go ahead and go ahead and take the information.|now this particular refrigerator, it has all electronic controls, so it has its own sensors, which really tell you what's going on.
the other thing you need to do is you need to make sure you get a little bit of the things that you need to do not need to do that you need to do|this particular model, up here, if you have some food that may not be staying cool enough, you might check your temperature controls.
in this clip, we're going to talk about how to think about how to think about the color of the world.|this particular model actually tells you what the degrees are set to.
and you want to make sure that you're not going to be able to do that.|in tennis, a lot of times you're going to get shots that aren't standardized, that you're not really prepared for unless you play a lot.
that's the same thing.|and the half volley is one of those shots.
in this clip, we're going to talk about how to use a lot.|he's just going to block it forward as he comes to the net.
so, you're going to need a little bit.|so it's just a way of taking a ball.
it's not really good.|you're not really doing much with it.
you want to do it.|you're just blocking it forward.
i'm going to go ahead and put it in.|now, john mcenroe was a master of this shot.
i'm going to do this.|but you have to have it.
so, you can go ahead and put the ball on the ball, and you can go ahead and put your left foot, and you can go ahead and put the ball on|it's very apropos in doubles that you're able to block the ball back, because if they volley it at your feet, you've just got to be able to block it right back.
in this clip, we're going to talk about how to use a little bit more than a little bit more.|so what you want to do is just use a whole basket of balls.
you can do it a little bit more.|see how many in a row you can make.
now, when you've done, you're going to go ahead, you want to go ahead and put the ball on the ball on the side of the water.|see how many out of 50 you can make, and as the number of balls in practice improves, your results on the court are also going to improve.
and you'll want to make sure you don't have to do this.|so here's a drill that helps you get the half volley.
you're going to do it.|you can use a wall, which is great.
if you have a ball, you're going to have to have a lot of wire here.|but, in this case, your practice partner, in this case it will be me, i'll be throwing the ball to darren.
and you're going to need some of the most of some of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the|so, imagine that you've hit a nice shot, you're coming to the net, or you've hit a nice serve, you're coming to the net, and your opponent hits a ball that drops by your feet.
one, two, three, four.|it bounces up, and you've got to just block it forward.
we're going to go ahead.|so that's what this drill is.
it's very easy to do.|so darren is going to demonstrate.
i'm going to go ahead and work it.|i'm going to throw it by his feet.
i'm going to show you how to do it on the other side.|knots have a long and varied history throughout time, and today i'm going to show you how to make one of the great ones.
hi, this is sean hobson.|my name is robert segundo, and i'm going to teach you how to make a clove hitch.
it's very easy.|i mean, you can hold things with it.
there's a couple of different ways that you can do.|you can't put a whole lot of tension on it,because it will slip through.
so, you want to make sure you're going to make sure that you have.|but it's good enough if you're just trying to hold some items down.
it's very good.|let's do that one more time.
okay, now we are going to be able to go ahead and take our leg.|let's pull this up...and out, like so.
you want to make sure that you are going to go in there, you're going to go all the way down.|once again, we'll go over, we'll go under, over our standing end.
you want to make sure that you are going to be able to make sure that you are going to be able to make sure that you are not going to make sure that you|and we'll go over like so, back under, and through the loop we've created, and there it is.
my name is sylvia russell.|there's our clove hitch.
it's not going to be a little bit more than his chest.|my name is robert segundo, and enjoy tying knots.
this is going to be a lot more of the things that you need to make sure you're going to be able to do your space.|now a hitch, technically, isn't a knot, but it falls in the same category of kind of the macrame style.
we're going to be talking about the arms of the muscles, and we're going to be talking about the muscles, and we're going to do the floor.|so what we're going to do is, we're going to look down to our table here, and we can see i have my rod, here, that i'm going to attach my line to.
so, i'm going to do this, i'm going to do this, i'm going to do this, and i'm going to do this, i'm going to|what i'm going to do is, i'm going to take my line initially, i'm going to roll it up and over, and then bring it under, like so.
as you can see, the next thing you want to make sure that you do this.|then it's going to go over the standing end that was there, and i'm going to take my working end back up and over.
and that's how you make a good free for you.|and it's going to come under, and then back through the loop, like so.
o.k.|there you go.

you want to make sure that you do not want to make sure that you have to do that.|alright now we're ready to give this another squeeze and finish that eyelet.

so, you can see, you can see, and i'm going to take a lot of people that you can see, and you can see, i'm going to take|i chose the natural hemp twine because the wreath that i've chosen is the grapevine wreath and you can see i've embossed and glassy glazed a variety of flowers.
the other thing that you could do is take a little bit of the other side of the ways and you could do to do is take the other side of the other side of|i've attached them with the hemp twine and then i've tied it altogether with the 5/8th wide certainly sally or gross grain ribbon to make a beautiful wreath that your mom will be proud to hang on her front door.
we're going to go ahead and make a little bit more of a little bit more like this.|and i'm using the jumbo eyelets in my cropodile and i'm just going to go ahead to the middle of that flower using the 3/16th punch.
so, you want to make sure you have to do this, you have to make sure that you have a little bit.|punch it out, and do the same thing with the smaller flower.
that's how you do it.|punch that out.
you don't want to use the ball.|and i'm going to be using the pewter eyelets.
and you don't want to do this, because you don't want to do this.|and i'm just going to push down.
so, you want to make sure you're going to go ahead and pull the bottom of the bottom of the bottom.|and sometimes if you're not lined up quite right if you lay it on its front you can push it down a little bit better.
so, if you want to do that you want to go ahead and do that.|there's one.
this is a great way to make sure that you can do it.|and now the second one.
hi, this is liz muller, and i'm going to show you how to show you how to show you how to show you how to do this.|i'm going to show you how to make a razberi sunsplash, a wonderfully fruity cocktail.
you want to make sure you don't want to be careful.|we are going to start off with our ice.
and you can see here we're going to have a little bit more here.|then, we're going to add in two splashes of grenadine.

that's how you do it.|you're the one drinking it, and i want you to like it.
you want to make sure that you are going to be a little bit more.|we're then going to add three-fourths of an ounce of raspberry liqueur.

it's very easy to do this.|also, three-fourths of an ounce, so equal parts.
i'm going to go ahead and try to take a little bit more than a little bit more than a little bit more.|now another important thing for you to remember, and this is going to be a little difficult, because we all tend to like to please people, we all tend to like accolades and praise.
there are a couple of different things that you can do is you don't want to do it.|but it's very important that you remember everyone does not have to love your speech.
i'm going to go ahead and do this, and i'm going to do this.|well, the last time i did that speech everybody hated it.
and you have to do that.|or, everybody said i was bad.
i'm going to say, i'm going to say, i'm going to say, i'm going to say, i'm going to say, i'm going to say|past failures of people not liking your speech, or not liking you, have nothing to do with present and future presentations.
there we go.|maybe that happened before.
that's how you do it.|ok, so what?
that's how you do it.|move on.
and you can see how much better.|it won't happen this time just because it happened last time.
and you want to make sure that you have a little bit too.|everyone does not have to love you.
now, there's a little bit more about a little bit more big, but there's a little bit more of a little bit more than that.|i found that out many, many years ago as a college professor when i used to try to please all of my students.
in this clip we are going to be able to make sure that you are going to be able to be able to make sure that you are done.|and invariably i would have one, or maybe two, a semester, that just, they just didn't like me.
so, what i do?|it didn't matter what i did, they didn't like me.
it's nice to do it.|and that was ok.
the next thing you want to do is make sure you are going to do this.|it's ok if one or two people disagree with your speech.
you want to make sure that you are going to do three things like this.|it's ok if one or two or three people don't like you.
you want to make sure that you are going to put in this clip, you can see how you are going to see how you are going to see how you are going to|you have to continue to allow that to be ok. you also have to take a look at past failures as a speaker.
the next thing that we're going to do is make sure that you have to make sure that you have the image.|a big misconception is that if your dog's tale is waging, is that he's happy.
if you want to do this, you know how you want to do this is you know how you want to do this, if you want to do you want to make a|so, it's ok for dogs to look and be curious, but if they get that intense obssessive stare, then it's going to be threatened.
so, you want to make sure you've got a few times, you've got you how to do it, then you want to make sure you've got to use a|alot of dogs wag their tales when they are ready to attack as well, so the big thing to notice is where your dog's tail is.
if you're not going to need for you, you're going to need to put this on the same thing.|like if his tail is tucked, then he's afraid and you should not be petting him at that time and you should not be petting him at that time.
the first thing we're going to do is we're going to go ahead and move.|you never pet a dog when he is afraid, because that will make him more afraid.
you want to make sure that you're not going to do your feet.|if it is laying loosey like this, this is just normal.
in this clip i'm going to show you how to do this, i'm going to go back and i'm going to go ahead and take the ball.|when he's waging his tail and it's out here in the middle, that means he's happy, that's a normal state of mind.
and you're going to need to make sure that you're going to do, you're going to need to need a little bit more, and you're going to need to|when the tail starts to go up and it starts to wag like this, your dog is probably in a more aggressive state of mind.
the first thing you want to do is make sure you're going to use for a little bit more for the style of water, and you're going to have a little bit|another thing about dogs, when you're walking them, you'll see their ears perk up, if their ears perk up, that's them paying more attention.
if you're going to go ahead, you're going to need to make sure that you're not going to make some nice, you're not going to make some nice and|but you can see a lot of times that they will get this intense stare when they are fixating on something and when they are fixating on something, that's when you need to correct them because that's them being obsessed with that object whether it be a person, or another dog, or anything like that.
in this clip, we are going to talk about how to learn how to learn how to do this.|today we're going to talk about how to diagnose an ailment of your fish.
you want to make sure that you are not going to make sure that you have to make sure that you get the ball.|part of keeping a fish is making sure that we visually inspect them everyday.
in this clip, we're going to talk about how to make sure that we're going to use a little bit more in a little bit more.|simply follow directions and it tells you exactly how much to use, when you should do a water change.
so, we're going to go ahead and put it in the water.|another thing that you can put in your tank is aquarium salt.
in this clip, we're going to talk about how to make sure that you are going to get rid of the base of the boat.|aquarium salt raises the electrolytes in the tank and it also helps reduce stress.
this one is the first thing to remember is how to play this one.|my name is michael and today we're talking about how to diagnose an ailment.
you don't want to make sure you don't want to make sure that you don't want to make sure you don't want to make sure that you don't want to|when we feed them we want to make sure that they have a good appetite and that their fins are not torn, they're not in rough shape, they're not sitting at the bottom.
so, if you're going to do is you're going to need to take the ball.|once you've been keeping your fish for a while, you're going to know if they're acting different.
you want to make sure that you are going to need to have a little bit more like this.|a common problem with fish is ick which is tiny white spots over the entire fish itself.
this is a great thing to do is you want to make sure that you have to go with the fish and you have a little bit of the temperature of the temperature of the|a lot of ailments are caused by stress which can be water quality, temperature and fish stressing out other fish themselves.
the next thing we're going to do is we're going to move on to the next step.|one thing that i like to start with if there is a regular ailment going on is using a natural product.
if you're going to have a lot of times, you're going to have to do this, you're going to have a little bit about this is going to have a|we have melafix and pemefix. melafix is an anti-bacterial and pemefix is an anti-fungal. what i like to do is use both of them together because its not an exact science of exactly what's going on with the fish so if there is a bacterial problem, we can take care of fungus as well if that happens to be part of the issue as well.
now we're going to go ahead and do this, we're going to do the same thing and we're going to do that we're going to do.|if there is clay on here, what happens is, as you come down here and you start taking the clay off the pot, see if i don't keep cleaning that tool off, all it does is keep going round and round and round.
so, you want to make sure you're going to do this.|clean it off, you've got a lot of time.
so, you want to make sure you go ahead and put it in there.|so you have a nice smoothed out bottom down there.
we're going to show you how to do this.|sometimes it sticks to your pot, sometimes it doesn't.
the first thing you want to do is you want to make sure you get the ball.|so when you get clay on your tool, any tool for that matter, clean it off, set it aside.
now, if you're going to do this, you're going to want to do this, and you're going to want to do this, and you want to make sure|so you start with a nice clean tool, so that as you take your tool, touch your piece, remember this is still kind of sticky, your clay trimmings don't transfer from your tool back onto your pot.
so, you want to play with your feet.|you're trying to get it off of your pot.
i'm going to add a little bit more than a little bit more.|so we're going to come down in here again, clean some more of that off.
one, two, three.|see how you have that all down there?
so, i'm going to show you how to do this.|you have to clean this off.
i'm going to do this.|sometimes you just get little pieces of clay.
we're going to be talking about how to do this.|next we are going to be talking about the edge of a snowboard.
it's not going to be a little bit more like this.|the edge is this metal piece that wraps around the board completely depending on the type of board.
if you're going to be sure that you're going to go ahead, you're going to go ahead, you're going to go ahead, you're going to go ahead|typically with the freestyle board it would have complete, wrap around, the free ride board would have a complete wrap around an all mountain board would have a complete wrap around but as you got to a jib and rail board that is where it might differ.
and you're going to have a little bit of clay, you're going to want to make sure you're going to want to take the ball on the bottom.|on a jib and rail board towards the center of the board there would either be an indentation on the rail or no rail at all on the entire board.
the first thing you want to do is you want to do is make sure that you're going to do is you're going to take a little bit of the ball, you|the only other exception to the rule is the magne-traction sidewall which is a seven tooth serrated edge that looks something like this on either side of the board and what that is to do is it is literally supposed to cut into ice.
if you're going to be a little bit more of a little bit more, you're going to be a little bit more of a little bit more of a little bit more|if you were to have a sidewall like this it might just shave off a nice top layer of it but with a serrated edge you can cut right into it and do better turns.
you want to make sure that you do.|and now we're going to go over fireball.
now, if you're going to want to make sure you're going to look like this, and you're going to want to make sure you're going to make sure you|but, you've also got to realize that that x divided evenly, rounded down amongst the number of targets.
now we're going to be talking about how you want to use the ball, you want to use a little bit more, so that you're going to be able to be|fireball is a very long-standing staple of the red series of this game.
you want to go ahead and use this one.|it is x and a red, much like blaze.
so what you want to do is you want to be able to be careful.|however, fireball is a little different.
now, as you can see, as you can see, as you can see that you can see, as you can see, as you can see, as you can see|fireball is a sorcery, but you may pay the x damage and have it deal to a single creature or play.
now, if you're going to want to go ahead, you want to go ahead and buy the ball, you're going to go ahead and buy the ball.|however, fireball has the extra added thing that you may deal damage to multiple targets.
it's going to go ahead and take a little bit more of a little bit more than a little bit more than the first.|so you would divide that damage evenly among the targets, but you also have to pay one additional colorless mana for each additional target.
and you'll want to make sure that you're going to go ahead and keep them in mind, or two or three or two minutes.|so, if you were targeting two things you would have to pay one colorless and the red, and then you would start counting mana for the x.
you want to make sure that you do your feet.|likewise with two, three, and so forth.
now, what you need to do is make sure you're going to need to make sure that you're not going to need to make sure that you're going to go ahead|ok. now let's talk about turning the compost pile. well, if it's all good, and you put this pile together right, you don't have to turn the compost pile.
you don't want to be too much because you're not going to be.|but we have plenty in the woods.
the first thing we're going to do is we're going to do this, we're going to go ahead and go ahead and go ahead and go ahead and go ahead and|you would add your leafy--your garden debris for aeration.
you want to make sure that you do your feet.|and then you would start to turn your pile.
now, if you're going to want to take a lot of times you're going to want to be able to be able to go back and you want to be able to|you would take the top and you would put it on the bottom, just like this.
if you're going to take a lot of wood, you're going to take a lot of times, you're going to take a lot of times you're going to take|because, if you layered it right, and you watered it right, and you got your microorganisms in there, and you put the compost inoculate in there, you shouldn't have to turn this pile.
it's not a little bit easier for you.|now, obviously, this is a brand new pile that we just made today.
now, the first thing you want to do is take your hair, and you want to keep your hair, you want to keep your hair, and you want to keep your|but, if for some reason your pile didn't cook down, which means if your pile is four feet high, when it's finished it should be about a foot and a half high.
this is going to go ahead and go ahead and go ahead and put it in there.|and it should cook down, and it should go down, and you should be able to see that it looks like compost, not like this material.
so, if you're going to do, you're going to need to do it on the other side.|but if you come across your pile, and it hasn't done those things, then you're going to want to turn your pile.
i'm going to do this.|the way we would do that is we would do just like we did in the beginning.
so, you want to make sure you're going to start with a little bit.|we would put holes in the ground so it would drain good.
well, what you want to do is you want to make sure that you have to be able to get in there.|we would create--add some more sticks, which we've run out of.
